In particular, there is no designated endocrine clinic for patients to access in Oxford. The increase was marked in the past 3 years, with 103 referrals from 2014 to 2016 compared with 59 from 2011 to 2013. Similar findings have been reported in child and adolescent services.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Our experience is also consistent with recent findings from a paediatric endocrinology service:<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> of 38 patients seen over a 13-year period, 74% of referrals to the clinic occurred during the past 3 years. In our detailed case note review of the 153 patients who attended for assessment, we also found a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity (in particular, depression and ASD), consistent with existing literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of our study were that there is a single point of access in Oxfordshire for onward referral to specialist gender clinics, so our case note review was able to capture all patients referred within a certain time period in this geographical area. We were also able to compare the results with those of our previous study in 2004&#x02013;2009.</p><p>Limitations of our study were that the clinic's assessment does not include a structured diagnostic interview, and although previous medical records were available in some cases, this was variable. Patients who had recently moved to the area, for example, might have had incomplete information in their local records, which might have particularly affected the large student population. Some information, such as on the number of patients taking hormones, was largely gathered through self-report, which may lead to underestimation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Consideration of reasons for changes in referral patterns</title><p>Examination of our referrals in more detail revealed that the patterns of referrals changed during the 6-year period, with mean age at referral decreasing. The prevalence of non-binary gender presentations also increased during the 6-year period, echoing the phenomenon discussed by Richards <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> This may reflect a change in how people's gender identities are developing, possibly because of the increased availability of information about non-binary genders from social media, the internet and peers. An alternative explanation might be that patients identified in this way previously, but perceived that if they disclosed this at assessment they might be denied treatment. It is conceivable that with greater awareness and less social stigma, these individuals may be developing more confidence about explaining their complex gender identities to professionals. The provision of comprehensive and accessible information to patients about options for gender identity and expression and possible medical interventions is crucial.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>We found similar rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders to those reported by others,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> with depression being the most common comorbidity. Like de Vries <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> we found anecdotally that after patients had declared their gender dysphoria to others, or &#x02018;come out&#x02019;, their mood often improved and self-harming behaviour reduced in frequency or ceased. Also, as in previously published literature,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> we found high rates of patients referred with a diagnosis of comorbid ASD (in our sample, about 8% of those attending for assessment). Although the assessment in the clinic does not include a structured diagnostic interview or a formal autism assessment, and hence our case note review only included previously established autism diagnoses, even this potential underestimate was still notably higher than the prevalence in the general population (estimated at 62 per 10&#x000a0;000 in a worldwide review<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>). This echoes the findings of de Vries <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> who systematically assessed children and adolescents referred to a gender identity clinic and found an incidence of ASD of 7.8%. They commented on the diversity of their findings, with both males and females having increased rates of ASD, and the variety of gender identity disorder diagnoses found in those individuals in their study with ASD. They speculated that in some individuals with ASD, feelings of gender dysphoria might be related to an experience of being &#x02018;different&#x02019; generally and having difficulty with identity development, or to more rigid and concrete ideas about gender norms.</p><p>An unexpected finding was that only 20 (13.1%) of patients were taking hormone treatment at the time of assessment, which is below the figure of 23% reported by Mepham <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Our study methods did not allow us to explain this discrepancy, although, like Mepham <italic>et al</italic>, proportionately more of our patients were transwomen taking oestrogens. Our findings do raise the possibility of underreporting, as hormone use was assessed through self-report, but this cannot be confirmed without more invasive methods such as blood tests, which were beyond the scope of our study. Another possibility would be that our sample truly had a lower rate of taking hormones, perhaps owing to an increased awareness of the medical risks of non-prescribed hormone treatment.</p><p>How can these recent marked increases in referral rates be explained? Our study does not provide any clues as to aetiology, but there are many possible explanations. An increase in referral rates can be due to an increase in the prevalence of the condition in the population, or to a change in help-seeking behaviour. Although our study does not provide evidence to differentiate between the two explanations, there have certainly been some recent cultural shifts which could influence the likelihood of patients with gender dysphoria seeking treatment. First, the public profile of transgender issues has been raised of late, with a recent increase in high-profile media figures such as Caitlyn Jenner and Chaz Bono coming out as transgender, and the broadcasting of a variety of documentaries about transgender people, including transgender children.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The internet also provides much greater access to information about gender issues, so that individuals can research their condition and treatment options, and connect with others for support and advocacy. Many people, for example, document the story of their transition on YouTube to provide others with encouragement and advice from their personal experience. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) support groups may also be more accessible because of the internet, and these also provide a source of peer support and information. Second, there have been campaigns to promote transgender people's rights and reduce discrimination in the UK and elsewhere, although significant stigma and discrimination do remain.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> All of this may have helped individuals with gender dysphoria to overcome barriers to seeking treatment, and potentially to presenting to healthcare professionals at an earlier age. Third, when patients present in primary care, or other contexts such as secondary mental healthcare, GPs and other health professionals have acquired a greater awareness of gender dysphoria and may be more likely to refer people for assessment.</p><p>However, decreased stigma and increasing access to information may not wholly account for changes in referral patterns, and additional factors may be needed to explain this. Advances in understanding the cause of gender dysphoria could help account for changes in prevalence; however, neurological studies investigating the possibility of structural or functional changes in the brains of those with gender dysphoria have as yet been inconsistent or inconclusive,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and it is difficult to see how they could account for rapid changes of the nature seen in this and similar studies.</p><p>The implications of our findings support those of other recent studies, and together suggest that commissioners and others need to take into account the accelerating trend in referrals when planning services. People with gender dysphoria are distressed by long waiting lists and perceived health inequalities.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In order to cope with increased demand, services need to provide multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams and networks that work and collaborate in the provision of services for people with gender dysphoria, as recommended in the Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x02019; guidelines.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Given the recommendations in ICD-11<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> that gender dysphoria be removed from the mental health section and renamed gender incongruence, a further question arises as to which medical discipline is most appropriate to provide these services.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Achim Wolf for his invaluable help and advice on statistical analysis and comments on the manuscript, and Dr Kate Saunders for her work on the previous study.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Josephine Fielding</bold>, MA, MRCPsych, is an Academic Clinical Fellow ST3 in Psychiatry at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK; <bold>Christopher Bass</bold>, MA, MD, FRCPsych, is at the Gender Clinic, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Judge</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>O'Donovan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Callaghan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gaoatsme</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name>
