The date of data collection was 4 April 2016. No patients were excluded from the study. Electronic records were analysed for a variety of criteria, including age on admission, date of admission, date of discharge, diagnosis, source of admission, location of discharge and convictions on admission. In the 2012 cohort, four patients had not yet moved on from the MSU on the date of data collection. Their discharge date was recorded as the date of data collection to give a minimum median length of stay for the 2012 cohort. These patients were excluded from the analysis of discharge destination.</p><p>Data compilation and analysis were performed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical analysis comparing length of admission of different cohorts was performed with one-way ANOVA using an internet-based calculator (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.statisticslectures.com/calculators">http://www.statisticslectures.com/calculators</uri>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>There were 47, 65, 37 and 30 patients admitted to the MSU in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2012, respectively.

This correlates with a reduction in the number of new admissions per year, down from a peak of 65 in 1995 to 30 in 2012. The duration of admission appears to have been relatively stable in the decades prior to the 2012 cohort; only in this cohort did the length of admission increase significantly.</p><p>The four patients in the 2012 cohort still in the MSU on 1 April 2016 each had a length of stay of at least three years and three months. Their final length of admission may be significantly longer, and we cannot know by how much the median length of stay is an underestimate.</p><p>Recommendations regarding treatment of mentally disordered offenders were made in the Glancy and Butler reports.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> These reports informed the development of the regional secure units (now known as MSUs) to complement the existing special hospitals (now known as high secure hospitals). An upper limit for length of stay of two years in the regional secure units was suggested, but this is now regularly exceeded, as this study shows. The increasing length of stay in MSU has been criticised, being deemed &#x02018;too long in very expensive and often unsuitable provision&#x02019; in a report by the Schizophrenia Commission.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Despite the aforementioned criticism of the increasing length of stay and the undoubted expense of a medium secure bed, these services have the potential to save society a significant financial burden. One report suggests an average saving of over &#x000a3;600&#x000a0;000 per patient transferred from prison to psychiatric units.</p><p>Information regarding the length of stay at a single site has been investigated previously.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, no studies have investigated how the length of stay has changed over a prolonged period of time. Therefore, we feel that the data provided by our study add to the literature and provide a primary example of how length of admission has changed across a significant period of time. When comparisons were made with these early studies, the length of admission was comparable with that of the earliest cohort of our study. For example, in one paper published in 1981, the vast majority of patients were discharged in less than one year, which fits with the length of stay of the 1985 cohort in our study.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> It would be interesting to see modern studies in these other hospitals, to identify whether they have witnessed similar increases in length of stay.</p><p>One of the major changes since 1985 is in how patients are treated. In the older cohorts, the principal role of the forensic mental health service was to ensure that the symptoms of the patient's mental illness had reduced or resolved; offending risk related to other factors such as personality, substance misuse, social circumstances or life choices was often not felt to be the domain of mental health services. This underwent a significant change in the following decades. Mental health services now provide far broader care to address these other aspects, as evidenced by the essential roles of the multidisciplinary team<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and the adoption of recovery principles. These important changes are time and labour intensive, and as such may be a contributing factor to the increased length of stay.</p><p>In the analysis of the discharge locations and admission sources of these patient cohorts, certain patterns emerged. Far fewer patients are discharged directly to their home. Our patients are often discharged to long-term MSUs, lower security psychiatric units or supported accommodation. Notably, therefore, despite the increasing length of stay, fewer patients are discharged directly into independent accommodation in the community. Numerous studies have provided detailed analysis of the follow-up of patients discharged from forensic psychiatry units.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Given the risks inherent in these patients returning to day-to-day life, further care in supported environments may reduce risk to others at a population level. Responses to serious untoward incidents have changed over time<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and may now be more likely to lead to greater restrictions for patients. This in turn may contribute to the increasing lengths of stay described above.</p><p>There are limitations to our study. As our cohort was from a single MSU, the general applicability of our findings may be limited. It is recommended that further research be undertaken to examine whether the trends identified here are reproduced in other MSUs.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>Funding</title><p>C.H.E. is funded by a National Institute for Health Research Academic Clinical Fellowship.</p></notes><notes id="nts2" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Charles H.
