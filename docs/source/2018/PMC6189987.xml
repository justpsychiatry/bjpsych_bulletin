Nevertheless, there are notable differences: ESA provides a basic day-to-day income for a claimant unable to work full time due to illness, whereas PIP provides a supplement for the increased costs of living with disability. Claimants may receive either benefit, or both, if eligible.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>ESA</title><p>ESA is awarded instead of Jobseeker's Allowance when a claimant is determined by the Department for Work and Pensions&#x02019; (DWP) WCA to have limited capability for work due to illness or disability. &#x02018;Limited&#x02019; does not imply <italic>no</italic> capability and claimants are assessed in terms of whether they can sustain full-time work (16&#x000a0;h per week or more).</p><p>ESA applications, once separate, are now being integrated into Universal Credit claims as the programme rolls out nationwide. As the assessment process remains the same, this article will use the term ESA to refer to either route of application.</p><p>To establish limited capability for work, a claimant initially needs only to provide a medical certificate from their doctor. At this point, their claim is processed and provisional payment is issued (if applicable). The claimant is then placed in the &#x02018;assessment phase&#x02019;, which lasts for 13 weeks, or until the DWP completes the WCA, whichever is longer. If this phase lasts longer than 13 weeks, successful claims will have any additional payment due as a result of passing the assessment backdated to the 13th week.</p><p>Following the WCA there are three possible outcomes:

Both are based on the presumption that functional impairments incur additional living costs. Unlike ESA, PIP is not means tested and eligibility is unaffected by savings, income, household or work status. Award duration varies from 1 to 10 years (an &#x02018;ongoing award&#x02019;) and successful claimants may still appeal the award length.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>The PIP assessment separates functional difficulties into two components: daily living and mobility.

ESA assessments are split between ten descriptors for physical disabilities and seven for mental, cognitive and intellectual function (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>). Scoring 15 points or more anywhere in the ESA assessment qualifies a claimant for the work group.

<boxed-text id="box3" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 3</label><caption><p>Advice on writing supporting clinical evidence</p></caption><p>The general structure for supporting letters advised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> is as follows:

Given the disadvantages claimants with mental health problems face,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> there are numerous areas where problems can arise.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Completing the questionnaire and initial review</title><p>Once a valid claim for ESA or PIP has been made, the case is referred to an independent medical assessment provider. The claimant is sent a Limited Capability for Work questionnaire (ESA50/UC50) or How Your Disability Affects You form (PIP2), covering their condition and its impact, and it is to be completed by them, or on their behalf. This is submitted along with any supporting clinical evidence. Once received, the assessor &#x02013; who may be an occupational therapist, nurse, physiotherapist, paramedic or doctor &#x02013; conducts an &#x02018;initial review&#x02019; of the file. They may request a face-to-face interview or decide there is sufficient evidence to make an immediate determination. Supporting clinical evidence can therefore make the process far more straightforward for the claimant.</p><p>Notably, supporting clinical evidence is not mandatory at any stage of the process. An independent review of the WCA for the Government concluded: &#x02018;it is essential that all relevant medical and allied evidence about the claimant is available to the DWP Decision Maker at the earliest possible stage in the assessment process.&#x02019;<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Following a more recent independent review of the PIP assessment,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> the Government accepted the DWP should make clear that the responsibility to provide further evidence &#x02018;lies primarily with the claimant and they should not assume the Department will contact health care professionals.&#x02019; The same problems exist with ESA applications.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><sec id="sec3-1-1"><title>Questionnaire problems</title><p>Claimants can face numerous difficulties when completing the initial questionnaire. In 2013 the High Court<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> identified 11 reasons why people with mental health problems may struggle with self-reporting at this stage, including: failure due to lack of insight, inability due to difficulties with social interaction or confusion and unwillingness because of shame or fear of discrimination. Failure to return the questionnaire may result in termination of the benefit. There are some safeguards against this for ESA, as the WCA Handbook<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> states:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Where a claimant has a mental function problem an assessment will be carried out even if the [medical questionnaire] is not returned.&#x02019;</p></disp-quote></p><p>However for PIP claims, failure to return the questionnaire can be more problematic. Regarding customers with additional support needs, the PIP assessment guide<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> states:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;1.12.2 Some may have an Appointee &#x02026; or support from a family member, carer, Community Psychiatric Nurse or other person who will usually ensure that the claimant is supported throughout the process. In those circumstances, the claimant would not be classified as requiring additional support from the DWP. These people already have support.&#x02019;</p></disp-quote></p><p>This assumption effectively means less protection for PIP than ESA applicants and makes early termination of claims more likely. In this event, supporting clinicians can write to the DWP to provide evidence as to how the claimant's condition has adversely affected their ability to fulfil their requirements, ask for good cause to be accepted and for the claim reinstated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Arranging the assessment</title><p>A determination is not usually made on initial review of paper evidence. The assessor may attempt to contact professionals named in the questionnaire for additional information or, more commonly, refer the claimant for a face-to-face assessment (as with 72% of ESA assessments in 2013).<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> If a claimant cannot reasonably be expected to travel to an assessment centre they can request a home visit, but this will almost certainly require specific supporting clinical evidence.</p><sec id="sec3-2-1"><title>Assessment problems</title><p>If a face-to-face assessment for ESA or PIP is missed, the case file is returned to the DWP to decide whether to accept good cause or to terminate the claim. Both ESA and PIP legislation require that the decision maker consider the claimant's state of health and the nature of their disability in making this determination.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> As such, these decisions can be challenged using clinical evidence to justify why the claimant was unable to attend.</p><p>Assessment providers will typically refuse to conduct a home visit if there is a history of violence or aggression, which may lead to an impasse if the claimant cannot attend the assessment centre. In such cases, it is advisable to write directly to the assessment providers, explaining why the individual cannot travel and offering to provide further evidence. This may allow a paper-only assessment to be conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>The face-to face assessment</title><p>The face-to-face assessment can be extremely stressful for claimants, although they can be accompanied by a person of their choice who may also provide evidence. The assessor should have read all available information beforehand, although further clinical evidence can be provided on the day. The claimant's overall presentation at the interview can form a large part of the assessment, which may be problematic for those who lack insight, have a fluctuating condition, under-report or have become adept at masking their difficulties. This further highlights the importance of supporting clinical evidence to provide the full context.</p><p>Following the assessment, the health professional completes a report including recommendations to the DWP, who make the final decision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Challenging decisions</title><p>The two initial stages of challenging an outcome are mandatory reconsideration and formal appeal. To challenge a decision, claimants must first request a mandatory reconsideration by the DWP, the legal term being &#x02018;any grounds revision&#x02019;. Mandatory Reconsideration requests must be submitted within 1 month of the original decision, however this can be extended by up to 13 months if there is good cause.<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> This 1-month rule applies not only to final award decisions but to any decisions made by the DWP, which carry right of appeal. For example, claimants could challenge the termination of their claim for failing to attend a face-to-face interview. In the real world, such situations are likely and mental health services may only discover essential information long after the designated 1-month limit. In these cases, clinical evidence should support both the original challenge and also why a late application for revision should be accepted. Even if application for a late revision is denied, a recent Upper Tribunal case<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> ruled that a claimant still has a statutory right of appeal if a late request is not considered.</p><p>If the Mandatory Reconsideration outcome is unfavourable, the claimant can then submit (within a month) an appeal to the independent Courts and Tribunals Service. Further clinical evidence can be provided. It is important to ensure claimants are aware that reconsideration or appeal of one aspect of a decision could lead to a potentially disadvantageous revision of the whole decision. For example, challenging a decision about PIP mobility could theoretically lead to an existing daily living award being revoked. Appeals can be withdrawn at any point prior to the hearing.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Supporting clinical evidence</title><p>Reports can be sent directly to the assessment centre or, preferably, given to the patient to submit with their completed questionnaire. Additional evidence can be provided at any point, however early submission ensures its use throughout all subsequent stages and may allow for a quicker decision. Most supporting evidence will be requested to establish whether a claimant meets the qualifying descriptors (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>), however it might also be necessary to provide evidence in response to, or in anticipation of, specific problems outlined above. For example, if a patient reports their ESA has stopped, it may be due to insufficient points scored during their WCA or because they failed to attend it at all. The clinical evidence should address the issue in question.</p><p>It is important that supporting letters are objective, link functional problems to health issues, expand on common clinical concepts (e.g. negative symptoms of schizophrenia) and state obvious clinical inferences explicitly (e.g. negative symptoms persist even during periods of remission). It should be remembered that DWP decision makers are not medical professionals and they may have a limited understanding of terminology or mental health problems.</p><p>Care plans can be valuable evidence if they demonstrate that a claimant cannot manage relevant domains of functioning, such as their own self-care. However, there is a danger of care plans inadvertently giving a positively skewed impression of functioning if they are too simplistic. One example is preparing meals: PIP defines a &#x02018;simple meal&#x02019; as &#x02018;a cooked one-course meal for one using fresh ingredients&#x02019;. Therefore, a care plan that refers to independent cooking but does not clarify that this extends only to the use of a microwave could adversely affect the outcome.</p><p>The DWP's overall definition of capability is more narrow than it might first appear and requires some measure of consistency; the claimant must be able to perform the given tasks reliably (defined as &#x02018;safely, repeatedly, to an acceptable standard and as often as is reasonable to require&#x02019;<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>) on a majority of days. In addition, judgments about qualifying for a particular descriptor need not be unequivocal and may be accepted on a balance of probabilities.</p><p>Finally, when providing clinical evidence, it is always worth bearing in mind that you must demonstrate not only whether a claimant is affected by their condition, but also whether they are affected in the specific legal ways that qualify them for the benefit. The best evidence will therefore directly address the descriptors and, as such, a working knowledge of the criteria is vital in ensuring that claimants have the best possible support throughout the process.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>With some basic knowledge, mental health professionals can play a key role in redressing the discrimination against people with mental health problems and ensuring accurate award decisions by providing relevant, well-written clinical evidence for benefits assessors. Clinicians should be vigilant in demonstrating individuals' needs eloquently, accurately and in a timely way. Through an appreciation of the additional stresses on patients applying for benefits, mental health services can provide better support and signpost appropriately to agencies such as Citizens Advice. Welfare expertise is outside the experience of many mental health clinicians, but a patient's access to (eligible) benefits is an important part of recovery. Clinicians should work towards forging closer clinics with the benefits system and supporting services such as benefits and welfare advice to enable better outcomes for patients. Professionals need to understand the subtleties and potential for discrimination in the system to best support people.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Alexander Galloway</bold> is a specialty doctor at Hertfordshire Partnership University National Health Service Foundation Trust, UK; <bold>Billy Boland</bold> is a consultant psychiatrist at Hertfordshire Partnership University National Health Service Foundation Trust, UK; <bold>Gareth Williams</bold> is a benefits adviser at the Mental Health Project, Money Advice Unit, Hertfordshire County Council, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Sturm</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gresenz</surname><given-names>CR.</given-names></name>
