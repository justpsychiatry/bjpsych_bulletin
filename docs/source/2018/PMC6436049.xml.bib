   A national survey investigated the implementation of mental health
   crisis resolution teams (CRTs) in England. CRTs were mapped and team
   managers completed an online survey.

      :name: sec_a2

   Ninety-five per cent of mapped CRTs (*n* = 233) completed the survey.
   Few CRTs adhered fully to national policy guidelines. CRT
   implementation and local acute care system contexts varied
   substantially. Access to CRTs for working-age adults appears to have
   improved, compared with a similar survey in 2012, despite no evidence
   of higher staffing levels. Specialist CRTs for children and for older
   adults with dementia have been implemented in some areas but are
   uncommon.

   .. rubric:: Clinical implications
      :name: sec_a3

   A national mandate and policy guidelines have been insufficient to
   implement CRTs fully as planned. Programmes to support adherence to
   the CRT model and CRT service improvement are required. Clearer
   policy guidance is needed on requirements for crisis care for young
   people and older adults.

Crisis resolution teams (CRTs) are multidisciplinary, specialist mental
health services that offer brief intensive home treatment to people
experiencing a mental health crisis, with the aim of averting hospital
admission wherever possible.(n.d.a) CRTs for working-age adults have
been implemented nationally in England since the National Health Service
(NHS) Plan of 2000,(n.d.b) and elsewhere in Europe and
Australasia.(n.d.c) The English national mandate for CRTs was
accompanied by policy implementation guidance(n.d.d); the CRT model it
specified has been endorsed in numerous subsequent policy
guidelines.(n.d.e) Trials suggest that CRTs can reduce in-patient
admissions and increase patients' satisfaction with acute
care.(n.d.f)\ :sup:`,`\ (n.d.g) However, when scaled up to national
level, the implementation of CRTs has been highly
variable,(n.d.h)\ :sup:`–`\ (n.d.i) and their effects on admission rates
have been disappointing.(n.d.j) In England, improving access to and
quality of mental health crisis care across the age range has been
identified as a priority by expert bodies and policy
makers.(n.d.k)\ :sup:`–`\ (n.d.l) To inform future mental health
workforce planning, in 2016 Health Education England commissioned a team
from University College London to conduct a national survey of CRTs.

Aims
----

The nationwide implementation of CRTs for working age adults in England
mandated by the NHS Plan(n.d.b) represents an unusually prescriptive
attempt to implement a new mental health service model on a national
scale. In this paper, we aimed to investigate the consequences of this
national implementation, through addressing two main research questions.
First, to what extent do CRTs adhere to the implementation guidance for
CRTs(n.d.d) that accompanied the national mandate? Second, how has the
implementation of CRTs changed, compared with results from a similar CRT
survey(n.d.m) conducted in 2012? Secondary aims were to map the
provision of CRTs in England for working-age adults, children, and older
adults and people with dementia; to explore variation in the local acute
care system contexts in which CRTs operate; and to describe the staffing
and access arrangements of CRTs.

.. _sec1-2:

Setting
-------

We sought to map and include all CRTs in England. CRTs were defined as
mental health services that exclusively provided brief, intensive home
treatment for people in mental health crisis with the aim of averting
hospital admission. Services that provided longer-term intensive home
treatment (e.g. assertive community treatment teams) or intensive home
treatment as part of a broader community service (e.g. within the
context of a community mental health team) were excluded.

.. _sec1-3:

Participants
------------

Team managers of each identified CRT were invited to participate in the
survey. Where the manager was unavailable, an alternative senior CRT
staff respondent was sought.

.. _sec1-4:

Measures
--------

The study team developed a 91-item questionnaire, informed by the
measure used in a previous CRT survey.(n.d.m) This included a mixture of
quantitative questions and questions requiring brief free-text
responses. Questions covered: current CRT staffing and caseload size;
referral and access arrangements, including opening hours, eligibility
criteria, referral routes and response time; working arrangements with
other acute services; the role of the CRT in decision-making regarding
hospital admission (‘gatekeeping’); staff training; and team philosophy
of care.

.. _sec1-5:

Procedures
----------

CRTs were mapped by multiple means, including registers of adult and
older adult CRTs from two research studies and a national quality
improvement network, and through the websites of all mental health NHS
trusts in England. CRT managers were asked to identify other CRTs in
their area (including teams for young people or older adults) when
contacted about the survey, in order to identify any CRTs previously
missed.

The survey met Health Research Authority criteria for a service
evaluation(n.d.n) and was approved as such by the North London Research
Consortium. Local processes for approving the service evaluation were
followed by the study team wherever required.

Details of mapped CRTs were entered into Opinio,(n.d.o) UCL's secure
online survey system. Team managers were then automatically invited to
complete the survey by email, through Opinio, and were also contacted by
researchers, sent an information sheet about the study and given the
opportunity to ask any questions. Following three, weekly automatic
Opinio email reminders, researchers contacted remaining non-responders
by phone. The option of completing the questionnaire as a telephone
interview was offered. Respondents consented to take part by completing
the survey: those who completed the survey online entered their own data
directly into Opinio; researchers entered the data into Opinio for phone
respondents.

The survey took place from September to November 2016. At the beginning
of December 2016, the online survey was closed and the data were
downloaded from Opinio into SPSS for Windows for data analysis. Data
files were stored on the secure, password-protected UCL IT system.

.. _sec1-6:

Analysis
--------

Data were analysed in SPSS and descriptive statistics were presented
separately for adult, older adult/dementia, and children and young
people's CRT teams. Survey questions which directly mapped on to
national policy implementation guidance for adult CRTs(n.d.d) were
identified, and the proportion of adult CRTs meeting each policy
recommendation was reported. For variables where comparable data were
available from both our survey and the 2012 national CRT survey,(n.d.m)
differences in responses between the two time points were explored using
bivariate statistics.

.. _sec2:

Results
=======

Overall, 198 adult CRTs, 15 CRTs for children and young people, and 31
CRTs for older adults and/or people with dementia were mapped. (One
adult CRT originally mapped in error was excluded.) Survey responses
were obtained from 190 adult teams, 13 children and young people's
teams, and 30 older adult teams: an overall response rate of 95%. Two
administrative health regions (NHS trusts) had no adult CRT services: in
these regions, crisis response was organised within broader community
mental health teams.

.. _sec2-1:

Adult CRTs' adherence to policy recommendations
-----------------------------------------------

`Table 1 <#tab01>`__ summarises how far adult CRTs were adhering to the
recommendations of the influential Mental Health Policy Implementation
Guide(n.d.d) which accompanied the national mandate for adult CRTs in
England. Only one team was fully adherent in all respects;
recommendations for having a multidisciplinary staff team and for
accepting referrals directly from general practitioners (GPs) and
patients were most frequently unmet. Regarding staffing levels, 76% of
teams met the minimum recommended staffing level of 14 full time
equivalent staff for a caseload of 30 patients, based on their current
caseload on the day of the survey. However, this figure dropped to 55%
of teams, based on their reported highest typical caseload. Table 1Adult

Changes to CRT implementation 2012–2016
---------------------------------------

`Table 2 <#tab02>`__ summarises recent changes in adult CRT
implementation, based on a comparison of results from this survey with
those from a previous national survey conducted in 2012.(n.d.m) Overall,
adult CRTs appear to be more accessible in 2016: compared with 2012,
significantly more CRTs accept self-referrals, provide a 24 h service,
and work with people with personality disorders and with older adults.
An exception to this trend is that fewer CRTs in 2016 accepted young
people aged 16–17 years. More CRTs in 2016 were able to access
non-hospital crisis beds, compared with 2012, and more teams in 2016
fulfilled a full ‘gatekeeping' function and assessed all patients before
voluntary hospital admission. Changes in CRTs' staff mix were less
marked, although social workers were less well represented and
psychologists were better represented in CRTs in 2016 than in 2012. The
proportion of teams meeting recommended minimum staffing levels fell
from 87 to 76%. Table 2Implementation of CRTs for working age adults in

CRTs within the acute care system
---------------------------------

`Table 3 <#tab03>`__ shows the different acute care contexts within
which CRTs operate. While all NHS trusts include acute in-patient wards,
there was wide variation in the availability of other crisis services
within local acute care systems. About half of adult CRTs were supported
by a separate, staffed crisis phone line, and had access to residential,
non-hospital crisis beds. About one-fifth of adult CRTs could access
places for patients at an acute day hospital. Three innovations in acute
care systems are highlighted by the survey. First, there is a split
between crisis assessment and crisis home treatment functions: nearly
one-third of adult CRTs are now supported by a separate triage/crisis
assessment service. Second, 15% of adult CRTs are supported by
non-residential crisis drop-in services, which typically function at
evenings and on weekends, and can signpost elsewhere or refer
individuals to CRTs. Third, specialist CRTs for young people and older
adults, which were not nationally mandated, have been developed: these
typically have less access than adult CRTs to other supportive crisis
services. Table 3Variation in the acute care systems within which CRTs

Staffing and access: adult CRTs
-------------------------------

Full descriptive results from the survey are provided in the
supplementary data (File DS1) available at
https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2018.19. Adult CRTs exhibited wide variation
in staffing and access arrangements. While most teams included nurses
(98%), psychiatrists (94%) and support workers (88%), whether teams
included social workers (57%), occupational therapists (48%) or
psychologists (39%) was much more variable. Current team caseloads
varied from 5 to 144 patients; current staffing varied from 3 to 69 full
time equivalent staff. A typical adult CRT, based on median scores,
comprised 21 full time staff for a caseload of 29 patients.

Eligibility criteria for adult CRTs also varied. Most teams (72%)
accepted patients over the age of 18 with no upper age limit, but only a
third of teams (32%) would support young people aged 16–17. This was in
the context of 13% of adult CRTs reporting that there was a local
children and young people's CRT which operated 24 h a day, and 6% of
adult CRTs with a local older adults' CRT operating 24 h a day. Half of
adult CRTs (50%) reported that they would accept patients with comorbid
learning difficulties, and only a minority (17%) supported people with
dementia. Referrals from GPs were accepted by 80% of teams;
self-referrals were accepted by two-thirds of teams (69%) if the patient
was already known to services, but by fewer than half (43%) if the
person was not previously known.

Most teams (93%) provided a 24 h telephone response, but just over
two-thirds (69%) operated a full 24 h service, including capacity to
make home visits. Half of adult CRTs (50%) reported that they always
assessed patients in person before hospital admission was arranged, but
only 19% of teams reported always attending Mental Health Act
assessments, which precede compulsory hospital admissions. Eighty-six
per cent of adult CRTs set a target response time for starting an
assessment, having accepted a referral for a patient in crisis, but
these targets varied from 1 h to 1 week. In 45% of teams, this target
response time was 4 h or less.

.. _sec2-5:

Staffing and access: children and young people's and older adult CRTs
---------------------------------------------------------------------

While nurses were represented in all teams, only a minority of children
and young people's CRTs (46%) and older adult CRTs (38%) included
medical staffing. Occupational therapists were included in a majority of
older adult teams (55%), and social workers in a majority of children
and young people's teams (61%). For children and young people's teams,
current caseload size ranged from 3 to 49 patients, and 59% of teams met
a minimum staffing level benchmark of 14 full time equivalent staff for
a caseload of 30 patients. For older adults, current caseloads ranged
from 8 to 226 patients; 59% of these teams also met the minimum staffing
level.

All but two of the children and young people's CRTs accepted all ages up
to 18 years the other two had lower limits of 11 and 12 years,
respectively. Of the 30 older adult teams included in the survey, 11
were exclusively for people with dementia, while the other 19 also
accepted older adults with mental illness. Compared with adult CRTs,
fewer CRTs for older adults (30%) and for children and young people
(46%) offered a full 24 h service, including capacity to provide home
visits. While most teams would accept direct referrals from GPs (69% of
children and young people's teams; 76% of older adult teams), fewer than
half would accept any referrals directly from patients or their families
(46% for people already known to services in children and young people's
CRTs; 45% in older adult CRTs). Target response times for starting an
assessment following a new referral were very varied, as in adult CRTs:
the response time target was 4 h or less for 64% of children and young
people's teams which set a target, and for 33% of older adult teams.
Only about a third of older adult and children and young people's teams
(31% for each) reported always assessing patients in person before
hospital admission.

.. _sec2-6:

Philosophy of care and staff training
-------------------------------------

Forty-four per cent of adult CRTs and 52% of older adult CRTs reported
having any philosophy of care or theoretical model which underpinned
their service, with the recovery model being by far the most common
response in each case. Only three of 13 children and young people's CRTs
reported any underpinning philosophy or model – either a ‘psychosocial'
model or a dialectical behaviour therapy approach. Fewer than half of
CRTs for adults (41%), older adults (28%), or children and young people
(31%) reported providing any CRT-specific training for the whole staff
team.

.. _sec3:

Discussion
==========

The survey findings show that current implementation of the CRT model is
highly variable. Almost no adult CRTs adhere fully to the model
recommended in policy guidance. This is consistent with the findings
from previous surveys.(n.d.h)\ :sup:`,`\ (n.d.m) Adult CRTs appear to
have become more accessible since 2012. The finding that fewer adult
CRTs met recommended staffing levels in 2016 compared with 2012 should
be treated with caution: it may be an artefact of a better response rate
to the relevant questions in the 2016 survey, and may also reflect the
proliferation of separate crisis assessment services, which, where
present, reduce the workload for CRTs in responding to new referrals.

While adult CRTs remain almost universal in England, CRTs for children
and for older adults are comparatively rare. The teams which do exist
may serve larger geographical areas than adult CRTs, but in most areas
of England, neither children nor adults with dementia can access crisis
support from a specialist CRT team. Children's and older adult CRTs are
typically less well staffed and less likely to be organised to provide
easy-access, 24 h intensive home treatment, compared to adult CRTs.

.. _sec3-1:

Strengths and limitations
-------------------------

The very high response rate provides confidence that this survey is
representative of CRTs in England. As a self-report questionnaire, it is
vulnerable to social desirability bias and to the possibility that
respondents do not all interpret questions in the same way. It provides
only a cross-sectional snapshot of CRT implementation at one moment in
late 2016, although the comparison with results from a similar survey in
2012 allow some assessment of changes over time. Our survey did not ask
about the types of intervention provided by CRTs.

.. _sec3-2:

Implications for research
-------------------------

Four priorities for future research can be identified from this service
evaluation. First, there is a need to evaluate mental health crisis care
systems, not just individual service models. `Table 3 <#tab03>`__ showed
that CRTs are operating in extremely variable acute service contexts;
these contexts – both the configuration of crisis services and the
continuity of care among them – are likely to influence outcomes for CRT
patients and the overall effectiveness and costs of acute care. The
separation of crisis assessment and home treatment teams in many areas
represents a major change in acute care in England, which appears to
have occurred in response to perceived local need rather than policy
guidance or supporting research evidence. We lack evidence about optimal
acute service system models. Second, a systematic review(n.d.p) has
highlighted the lack of high-quality evidence regarding older adult
CRTs, and evidence is equally lacking for effective models of crisis
care for younger people. It is unclear whether an adult CRT model is
also appropriate for these client groups, or how the model should
differ: specification and evaluation of CRT service models for children
and older adults is required. Third, our survey suggests that CRTs may
be improving access to care without increased staffing resources. This
may be occurring in the context of increased demand for CRT services and
reduced budgets.(n.d.q) The effects of absorbing these pressures on the
quality of care delivered to CRT patients are unknown. The need to
understand the relationships between CRT resources, service organisation
and access, and the quality of care provided to patients is therefore of
high importance. A recently developed fidelity measure for CRTs(n.d.r)
offers a means to assess the organisation and delivery of care in CRT
services rigorously and reliably, which could help to address this need.
Fourth, the lack of adherence to best practice recommendations in adult
CRTs indicates a need to develop resources to support CRTs in achieving
high model fidelity and service quality. A current nationally funded
study(n.d.s) is evaluating a service improvement programme for CRTs in a
cluster randomised trial, which, if effective, should help to address
this need.

.. _sec3-3:

Implications for practice
-------------------------

A generalisable implication of this service evaluation is that a policy
mandate and guidelines are insufficient to achieve complete and
consistent implementation of a desired service model. Active monitoring
and support has been shown to be essential for the successful
implementation of complex interventions in mental health in
international contexts.(n.d.t) Clear specification of desired service
standards for CRTs, with audit and service improvement support to
identify and address difficulties with implementation, is required for
CRTs at local and national levels. For example, there is a huge
difference for someone in a mental health crisis between waiting an hour
for CRT support and waiting a week – yet this is the range of local
response time targets reported by CRTs. This survey provides
benchmarking data, which can inform the setting of feasible national
standards for CRTs and assessment of future changes in CRT
implementation. The apparent recent improvements in the accessibility of
CRTs suggested by our survey may indicate that recent national policy
campaigns in England to achieve better access to mental health crisis
care(n.d.l)\ :sup:`,`\ (n.d.u) have had some positive effect.
Notwithstanding the need for more research evidence about effective
service models, the current ‘postcode lottery' found by our survey
regarding the availability of specialist crisis services for children
and older adults indicates a need for action from policy makers and
service planners to ensure appropriate services are provided in all
areas for these vulnerable groups at times of crisis.
