This provided a minimum 12-month follow-up period. Clinical records were reviewed to identify patient demographics and clinical details including medication compliance and response to treatment, which was determined by Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> combined with segregation use and incident frequency for 12 months before and after SOAD approval for nasogastric clozapine.</p><p>The method used to deliver nasogastric clozapine is outlined within <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>.
<boxed-text id="box1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><p>How to deliver nasogastric clozapine.</p></caption><p>Clozapine preparation</p><p>Although several brands of clozapine are available and unlicensed &#x02018;special&#x02019; oral suspensions can be prepared (including crushed tablets), we advocate the use of Denzapine as this is currently the only licensed oral suspension in the UK. If an alternate clozapine provider is currently in operation, then registration of the hospital and prescribing psychiatrist with a second supplier are necessary before transferring the patient's registration. This risks using two clozapine monitoring systems in one hospital, with possible confusion regarding dispensing medication and liaising with different clozapine-monitoring services as well as the potential of having to switch providers once the patient is established on tablet medication.</p><p>Restraint</p><p>A thorough risk assessment is required to ensure adequate numbers of trained, competent and resilient staff are present and it is essential they are well supported by the leadership team; consultant presence was initially provided, being replaced by more junior medical staff when confidence grew. At least one member of Resus Council (UK) &#x02018;Immediate Life Support&#x02019; trained member of staff must be present. Throughout every intervention, patients should be repeatedly given the option of taking oral clozapine. Mechanical restraint was considered as an option but, even with our most difficult patients, was neither planned nor used. Manual restraint was sufficient with between two and six members of staff; in the most extreme cases one member of staff was allocated to each limb, with two controlling the head. Patients were usually seated upright on the edge of their bed, with their neck in line with their back. Precautions may be required to mitigate risks of spitting and biting, including lightweight disposable face visors and gloves.</p><p>Nasogastric tube placement</p><p>Appropriate training for both medical and nursing staff can be arranged with a general hospital clinical skills team. Fine bore feeding tubes should be used. The first-line, gold-standard method of confirming placement in the stomach is by demonstrating a gastric pH of &#x02264;5.5.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Acid-inhibiting medication reduces the sensitivity but does not alter the specificity or render the method unsafe<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>; actions to reduce this risk should be considered. Radiological confirmation is not required.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Once placement is confirmed, nursing staff can administer the clozapine, which varies in volume (50&#x000a0;mg/ml) throughout titration. Unless safe to leave <italic>in situ</italic>, the nasogastric tube should be removed immediately after clozapine administration.</p><p>Legal authority</p><p>In England and Wales, incapacitous or non-consenting patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 may be administered drug treatments for mental disorders for longer than 3 months only if a Second Opinion Appointed Doctor (SOAD) approves the treatment, including the route of administration. Personal communication from the principal SOAD has indicated that the oral and nasogastric routes are equivalent: both are enteral.</p><p>Ethical dilemmas</p><p>Explored by Silva <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>, there are ethical dilemmas with administering nasogastric clozapine. These involve balancing the risks and benefits of an unacceptable status quo against the uncertainties of the possible risks and benefits of intervention, alongside containing and resolving the emotions of the team when using a novel, restrictive and coercive treatment on a vulnerable and incapacitous patient.</p></boxed-text></p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>E.S. had cared for five patients, whose demographics can be seen in <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, where a SOAD approved the administration of clozapine via a nasogastric tube.

Patient 2 only commenced oral clozapine after SOAD approval for nasogastric clozapine, but nasogastric administration itself was never required. Patient 3 commenced oral clozapine after persuasion, but threatened to stop and SOAD approval was enough to maintain compliance without nasogastric administration being necessary. Patient 4 took oral clozapine for 1 month but then repeatedly threatened to refuse. SOAD approval was sought and nasogastric clozapine was administered once, which was enough to maintain compliance thereafter. Patient 5 maintained erratic compliance with oral clozapine and despite taking it for 617 days, was approved for nasogastric clozapine because of life-threatening clozapine withdrawal catatonia that had previously been unresponsive to benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In the 12 months after SOAD approval for nasogastric clozapine, he received it four times on non-consecutive occasions over the first 6 months.</p><p>All five patients were considered to have shown a global improvement on CGI scores after the initiation of an assertive approach to clozapine, with the drug efficacy index showing that, for the majority of patients, clozapine had resulted in a &#x02018;vast&#x02019; or &#x02018;decided&#x02019; improvement in their condition (<xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

There were fewer restraints and enforced nasogastric clozapine administrations than had been expected, and one patient who had repeatedly refused oral clozapine for years cooperated without nasogastric administration at all, although this was also a finding when intramuscular clozapine was enforced in the Netherlands.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p><p>It is possible that teams redoubled their efforts, that patients were aware of the possibility of restraint and were coerced by the prospect alone or that patients regained a level of insight, or even a combination of the three; it is difficult to tell.</p><p>As Silva <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> discuss, teams that embark on this approach are faced with very difficult decision-making, such as how long to persist with one attempt at passing a nasogastric tube? When is a patient's distress at the procedure too great? And how many times should clozapine be administered via a nasogastric tube before accepting that oral compliance will not be maintained? These questions are not easy to answer, and the judgements can only be made by individual teams and will vary on their own capacity to maintain treatment and a relationship with a patient in very difficult circumstances.</p><p>For some patients their previous refusals will be based on psychotic motivations and it is hoped that these patients may quite rapidly respond. Others may have a combination of psychotic, personal and possibly comorbid motivations that may not be remedied by either clozapine or this assertive approach. For these patients, we would not advocate the regular use of nasogastric administration of clozapine as a long-term solution. We know, particularly when huge effort and resources are expended on initiatives, that there can be a tendency to get stuck in a persisting course of action or to fail to consider alternative approaches<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> (although in this case many of these are less likely to work<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>), and teams must be careful not to fall into this trap.</p><p>One good alternative, with local guidelines emerging,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> is the option of trying to establish patients on clozapine by an assertive approach with intramuscular injections. Having recently become available again, intramuscular clozapine may be preferred to nasogastric clozapine, given the less intrusive and unpleasant method of administration. However, unlike nasogastric clozapine, intramuscular clozapine is limited by the deliverable dose and therefore duration of treatment, with large volumes required (25&#x000a0;mg/ml) as the titration increases toward the average UK dosage of around 450&#x000a0;mg/day.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Intramuscular clozapine also remains an unlicensed product, with an increased likelihood of prone restraint and a theoretical risk of accidental intravenous administration. Therefore, although intramuscular clozapine provides an additional treatment option, nasogastric clozapine can continue to have an important role to prevent re-titration and administer clozapine when the maximum deliverable dose of intramuscular clozapine is insufficient.</p><p>Another alternative, where an assertive approach to clozapine fails or for the significant number of patients who do not respond to clozapine monotherapy or clozapine augmentation strategies, is the more restrictive treatment of ECT, which may well be the most appropriate next step.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> However, for the cohort we describe, this intervention is particularly difficult to deliver and maintain the safety of both staff and patients.</p><p>Ethically, what remains is a real argument about the wrongs of a failure to treat the most severely ill patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia against the perceived wrongs of nasogastric clozapine. Clearly, this approach can never be a panacea: clozapine can often not be used (because of adverse effects) and nearly 50% of patients fail to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic response.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, for those who have suffered with the most debilitating conditions imaginable, clozapine can result in dramatic and seemingly unexpected improvements in mental state and function. Accepting a patient's refusal of treatment and failing to offer them that chance of improvement via an assertive approach to clozapine through nasogastric administration seems, in our opinion, cruel and unnecessary.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our case series shows that nasogastric clozapine can be safely delivered and that the approach itself, rather than actual nasogastric administration, may be enough to establish and maintain treatment with clozapine.</p><p>An assertive approach to clozapine can therefore play an important role in managing patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It can be justified to help reduce patients&#x02019; extreme suffering and distress as a result of their psychosis, can be expanded in a variety of psychiatric in-patient settings and can help reduce the usually disappointing outcomes seen with other drugs or drug combinations.</p><p>This is the first systematic description of the assertive approach to clozapine and helps counter likely objections regarding the efficacy and risk of administering nasogastric clozapine that might otherwise prevent or delay patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia receiving the recommended treatment of choice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Alex Till</bold> is a psychiatric trainee in the School of Psychiatry at Health Education North West (Mersey), UK. <bold>James Selwood</bold> is a clinical research Fellow in the School of Clinical Sciences at the University of Bristol, UK. <bold>Edward Silva</bold> is a consultant forensic psychiatrist at Ashworth Hospital, Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Siskind</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McCartney</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Goldschlager</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kisely</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name>
