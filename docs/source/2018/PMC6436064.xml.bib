The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) has now been in operation for 10 years,
and MCA case law has proliferated over this time. Books on this subject
still remain vital to continue to embed this statute in practice. This
book is a reprint of the original publication in 2013. It is aimed at
psychiatrists and other mental health professionals and aims to provide
‘user-friendly’ guidance for medico-legal dilemmas that require an
understanding of the MCA (and where it juxtaposes with the MHA statute).
It is a readable book of only six chapters and 128 pages, which should
appeal to busy professionals.

All chapters contain salient advice. Probably the most apposite chapter
is that on best interests, especially with important case law having
emerged in this area in recent years since the book was published (and
given a prescient statement regarding best interests assessments and the
need to fully involve the person and people who know them well that
psychiatrists ‘have not been accustomed to this type of thinking’, which
this chapter readily addresses). The section on the role of the Court of
Protection is enlightening. Useful advice around the practical
challenges of applying the MCA in the clinical setting is elucidated in
the final chapter analysing clinical ambiguities in the assessment of
capacity.

The book could have been improved for the reader by having easy to read
learning points at the end of each chapter, and by having an annexe with
the relevant MCA sections cited in full. Also, because case law does
evolve, having a section recommending various legal resources would be
helpful to enable professionals to readily keep up to date, e.g. online
legal search engines and access to free monthly legal newsletters. A
table comparing enduring power of attorney and both types of lasting
power of attorney would also be useful.

It is unclear as to why the book has been reprinted without being
updated with the advances in MCA case law since 2013. Some of these
advances have been seminal in nature, especially in the areas of consent
to treatment, best interests, end-of-life care and Do Not Attempt
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation orders, and, importantly Deprivation of
Liberty Safeguards (DoLS), namely the ‘acid test’ that emerged from the
Supreme Court after a ‘DoLS-athon’ in the lower courts. However, it
still covers many areas of the MCA well enough for clinical practice,
and is indeed ‘user-friendly’. It is a shame it wasn't updated, as it
would undoubtedly then be an extremely useful book to have for clinical
practice.
