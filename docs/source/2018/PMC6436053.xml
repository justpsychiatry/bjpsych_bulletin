At least half of all referrals to EIP services should have access to and commence a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-concordant package of care for psychosis within 2 weeks of referral. Although EIP services had promoted easy access and prompt responses to new referrals since their inception, the new policy offered detail on how to achieve and report the Standard. In addition, the policy, in accordance with NICE recommendations,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> provided information about the need to expand current care provision in order to treat those individuals that might be at risk of developing psychosis, and to ensure prompt access and treatment for people with a first-episode psychosis regardless of their age. The effect of age inclusivity on the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of previously youth-oriented services was unknown. In fact, those EIP services that adhered to the new policy in full entered an uncharted territory that, inevitably, would require cultural and structural changes. However, the magnitude of these changes was unclear and not fully informed by previous evidence. For instance, the paucity of studies on the administrative incidence of first-episode psychosis in people aged over 35 assessed in early intervention settings<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> complicated new workload calculations and commissioning decisions.</p><p>The CAMEO EIP service in the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.cameo.nhs.uk">http://www.cameo.nhs.uk</uri>) decided to conduct a service evaluation to determine the initial effects of this policy change and assess how well it was achieving its intended aims with this population. In the first instance, CAMEO managers and clinicians were particularly keen to explore the immediate implications for the clinical service, especially with regards to referral numbers and sources for individuals aged over 35 with a suspected first-episode psychosis.

What little is so far known has been gathered from services already offering a broader EIP service in predominantly urban areas prior to 2016.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> By collecting data after the introduction of the new Access and Waiting Time Standard,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> we were able to evaluate the effects of these changes in existing EIP services, such as CAMEO, and anticipate further challenges and opportunities.</p><p>Following the changes to our service, almost 26% of new referrals were for patients over 35 years old. This confirms previous evaluations in early-adopter services, which suggested that patients over the age of 35 would make up a significant proportion of referrals, ranging from 25 to 33%.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> A higher proportion of patients over the age of 35 were referred from secondary and acute care in comparison with those aged under 35; the over-35s were more likely to have existing mental health issues.</p><p>Since referral processes may differ across EIP services, data from early-adopter services are difficult to compare with ours; however, they also suggested relatively few referrals from primary care for this older group. This might reflect lack of awareness in the wider health system, but, for some patients, it may well be related to psychosis developing as a secondary feature of depression and other conditions for which they had already received some support.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Interestingly, 50% of referrals for over-35s were taken on by our early intervention service, whereas only 40.2% of referrals for under-35s were accepted to case-load. This would also support the idea of those aged over 35 suffering from a longer history and higher burden of mental health issues.</p><p>Previous studies suggested a different distribution of diagnoses for older <italic>v.</italic> younger patients, with an increased proportion of primarily affective psychoses in over-35s.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Our results reaffirm these findings, with 16% of over-35s suffering from psychotic depression. The proportion of our patients aged over 35 with non-affective psychosis, approximately 55&#x02013;60%, is similar to that found by previous evaluations and lower than would be expected in younger patients, where non-affective psychosis is usually reported in approximately 75% of cases.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> This is consistent with the natural course of mood disorders, such as resistant depression, which becomes progressively more prevalent in older patients, some of whom may have suffered hypomanic episodes for which they did not seek treatment. Non-affective psychotic disorders are less likely to present for the first time over the age of 35.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Also, the higher representation of females in our over-35s sample and those of other studies may reflect a bimodal pattern of psychotic disorders in women, with an first peak at around the same age as in men (18&#x02013;25 years) and a further peak, usually of an affective nature, in the 40s.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> A willingness to treat these older female patients would support age inclusivity across EIP services.</p><p>Selvendra <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> showed that older patients referred to their mental health service in Italy had been unwell for significantly longer than younger patients. Our results, from an EIP context, also found a statistically significant difference in DUP between over- and under-35s. This indicates the need to continue to enhance outreach approaches to detect emerging psychotic symptoms earlier,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or to consider different approaches for a group of patients whose illness may have become more chronic by the time they are assessed by EIP services.</p><p>Although only three referrals were not taken on by CAMEO owing to comorbid dementia in our evaluation, other studies have shown a steady increase in transition to organic pathology in older patients. In fact, neurodegenerative diagnoses creep into the fold as the upper age limit increases above 35.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Accordingly, follow-up studies of over-35s treated in EIP services under the new Standard<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> will be required in order to evaluate this potential clinical issue and the subsequent effects on services that are not designed to treat such conditions.</p><p>In summary, our evaluation has begun to unfold the practical challenges that the implementation of the new Access and Waiting Time Standard<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> brings to established EIP services with regards to age inclusivity. The CAMEO service received a significantly higher number of referrals as a result of this, with an increased proportion of patients suffering from severe, acute psychotic presentations and with existing mental health issues for which they had already received treatment. These patients were more likely to be referred from secondary mental health services after an acute crisis, and to have longer DUP and psychotic symptoms in the context of other conditions, such as mood disorders.</p><p>The main limitation of this evaluation pertains to the collection of data from electronic records routinely employed in clinical practice; some clinical information was missing and working diagnoses were not confirmed with structured diagnostic questionnaires. However, data on referral numbers and sources, which represented the main purpose of this work, were complete and will aid future analyses on clinical and functional outcomes after completion of the early intervention care pathway. This should help to determine whether EIP services, as currently implemented, achieve the required standards with a group of patients whose characteristics clearly differ from those traditionally treated in what used to be exclusively youth-oriented clinical services.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of CAMEO services for their help and support with this evaluation.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Felix Clay</bold> is Core Trainee in Psychiatry at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; <bold>Sophie Allan</bold> is Assistant Psychologist at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; <bold>Serena Lai</bold> is Consultant Psychiatrist at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, <bold>Siona Laverty</bold> is Foundation Year 2 Doctor at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; <bold>Grace Jagger</bold> is Specialty Trainee in Psychiatry at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; <bold>Cate Treise</bold> is Clinical Psychologist at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; and <bold>Jesus Perez</bold> is Lead Consultant Psychiatrist at CAMEO Early Intervention Services, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Associate Lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Honorary Professor of Psychiatry at the University of East Anglia and Lead Director of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network in the East of England.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><collab>NHS England</collab>. <italic>Guidance for Reporting Against Access and Waiting Time Standards: Early Intervention in Psychosis</italic> NHS England, <year>2016</year> (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/resources/access-waiting-time/">https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/resources/access-waiting-time/</uri>).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><collab>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</collab>. <italic>Psychosis and Schizophrenia in Adults: Quality Standard 80</italic> NICE, <year>2015</year> (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs80/chapter/quality-statement-1-referral-to-early-intervention-in-psychosis-services">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs80/chapter/quality-statement-1-referral-to-early-intervention-in-psychosis-services</uri>).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Greenfield</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Christian</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lekkos</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gregorowicz</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name>, <etal/>
