   This paper presents a debate in which the authors participated at the
   World Psychiatric Association conference in Cape Town, South Africa
   in November 2016. Professor van Staden acted as chair and here, as at
   the debate, provides a rationale for debating a topic that many of
   those involved in mental health believe to be decided. The discussion
   that ensued demonstrated, however, that while the arguments have
   moved on they have not ceased. Who won? Well that depends how you
   look at it. A few in the audience shifted position towards the motion
   but the majority remained opposed. What do you think?

Introduction: Werdie van Staden
===============================

‘Preposterous’ or ‘high time’ may be the respective responses of
antagonists and protagonists to the claim that the concept of culture
has outlived its usefulness for psychiatry. Philosophical rigour,
however, requires much more than an exclamation of sentiment. Such
rigour is probably demonstrated best by articulating an argument that
goes against one's own sentiment, thereby unpacking and clarifying the
issues at stake. This article follows suit, thus not committing our
contributors beyond the remits of this article – an article that is
about the ‘what’ (i.e. the content) as well as the ‘how’ (i.e.
argument).

The topic is patently relevant considering the provisions for culture by
the DSM-5,(n.d.a) specifically through cultural concepts of distress,
the cultural formulation and the cultural formulation interview. In
addition, connections between culture and mental health may variously
and profoundly be found in the way culture affects the various mental
disorders in their expression, experience, interpretation, course and
outcome. One may assert that culture influences individual resilience,
coping mechanisms and social response, which are all crucial for
recovery from mental health problems. Anthropologically, one may assert
that mental health practice involves the meeting of at least two
cultural worlds: the clinician's and the patient's.(n.d.b)

A scholarly debate provides for consideration, if of good logical
pedigree, of the differences as well as the similarities shared by both
sides of the debate. As an introduction to the arguments of our pairs of
protagonists and antagonists, two shared features are highlighted:
‘culture’ necessarily involves *practice* and *values*.

The first protagonist, Mohammed Rashed, raises the issue of the
conceptual relation between cultural group identity and culture as a
dynamic set of shared practices. Taking the latter rather than the
former as constitutive of culture, cultural group identity is shown to
be a conceptual derivative of shared practice rather than the (commonly
assumed) converse. The premise also underpins the antagonist argument of
Abdi Sanati below. Following Wittgenstein's private language argument,
he argues that without culture there cannot be language, and, hence, no
psychiatry.

The premise that culture is constituted by shared practice thus features
on both sides of the debate, with conceptual implications that are
beyond the scope of this article. One example, nonetheless, may serve to
enlighten their arguments. This premise unmasks the mistaken assumption
that culture is necessarily confined to a geographical location (as does
the DSM-5).(n.d.b) Examples of the contrary are found in shared
practice: the internet culture, the renaissance culture, a scientific
culture, a 21st century culture, a ‘Googling’ culture, etc.

An emphasis on values is shared by the arguments of the protagonist,
Norman Poole, and the antagonist, Rachel Bingham. The inevitable
cultural origins of values are underscored in Bingham's argument,
whereas Poole is concerned by the alienating and exoticising
consequences of ascribing mental disorder to cultural values.

Space here does not allow for rebuttal, but the scene is set, no doubt,
for further discussion.

For the motion, Mohammed A. Rashed
==================================

I am going to argue for this motion: I believe that the concept of
culture has outlived its usefulness for psychiatry. I believe so not
because I am a defender of a reductive, biological psychiatry – I am not
– but because among the two definitions of culture that are, in my view,
of relevance to mental health, the first is so general so as to dissolve
into the concept of meaning, and the second is so unjustifiably
homogenising as to require that we explore the patient's beliefs and
values without the assumption of a cultural group.

Culture has many definitions; I list four. 1Culture in the sense of
activity: the tending of natural growth; to cultivate the land, to breed
animals, and to await the growth of bacteria in a Petri dish.(n.d.c)
This meaning of culture is irrelevant to our debate.2Culture also in the
sense of activity, but instead of cultivating vegetables and bacteria,
we cultivate our intellectual capacities and create civilisation. This
meaning of culture lives today in the ‘culture’ section of
newspapers.(n.d.d) This meaning of culture, as well, is not relevant
here.3Culture as a noun, denoting groups of people united by shared
beliefs and practices; for example, Maori culture, Muslim culture, and
so on.(n.d.e) This meaning of culture is relevant.4Finally, culture as
socially acquired and shared symbols, meanings and significances that
structure experience, behaviour, interpretation and social interaction;
culture ‘orients people in their ways of feeling, thinking, and being in
the world’ (Jenkins & Barrett 2004,(n.d.f) p. 5; see Rashed 2013,(n.d.d)
p. 4). This concept of culture is analytic in the sense that its
introduction enables researchers and theoreticians to account for the
specific nature of, and the differences among, various social phenomena
and people's subjective reports of their experiences. For example, a
prolonged feeling of sadness can be explained by one person as the
effect of a neurochemical imbalance, by another as the effect of
malevolent spirits, and by another as a test of one's faith: these
differences can be accounted for through the concept of culture.

Having identified two meanings of culture that are relevant to this
motion, I want to show why we should abandon the term culture. Consider
the final definition: culture as socially acquired meanings and
significances. Here we are talking about interpretation and giving
meaning to our experiences, to the experiences of others, to social
events and to behaviour. For example, in many societies, there exists
the phenomenon of the evil eye.(n.d.b) This is an innate capacity to do
unintentional harm through a direct look when encountering abundance or
beauty in situations that evoke genuine admiration and appreciation. It
may affect animals, plants, material possessions and human beings.
People for whom this notion is relevant regularly explain misfortune –
for example, if a tree dies or a well dries – by saying that a person
who visited recently had given a ‘bad eye’. For other people, however,
seeing a friend's new car is an occasion to say something like
‘congratulations’ and to ask go for a drive, without worry that one
might have, inadvertently, given the bad eye.

Now, both approaches to such a social encounter involve an
interpretation and a related response, and this applies to all social
encounters irrespective of where the involved individuals come from. But
then what part does the term ‘culture’ play here? If everything is
culture, in the sense that everything is subject to interpretation, then
it would seem that we just need to attend to that without having to
invoke an overarching thing called ‘culture’. It could be objected that
the term culture is helpful because it allows us to identify a certain
set of interpretations that occur together regularly, and to give that a
name. This brings us to the third definition of culture I mentioned
earlier: culture as a noun denoting groups. So, for example, the benefit
of using the term Maori culture is that we can refer to a set of
interpretations and practices that Maoris do: a shorthand to refer to a
whole group and ascribe to them certain beliefs and practices. This,
however, is problematic. The idea that we can demarcate a group of
people that believe this or that and do such and such has been debunked
as an anthropological fiction belonging to the European missionaries and
adventurers of the first half of the previous century. It downplays
individual agency in favour of some homogenous thing called ‘those
people's culture’.(n.d.c) Consider, again, the evil eye, a phenomenon
which I studied in Egypt. No two people agreed on what it meant, on its
importance, on the extent to which it is a genuine problem, or on the
situations in which it can be harmful. In fact, the description I gave
earlier is quite partial; people appropriated the notion and made it
their own, and they had a unique sense of what it is and whether or not
it is relevant to them.

The notion of a cultural group may be useful politically, but it's not
useful for psychiatry. The clinical encounter must always involve a
serious inquiry into the person's beliefs and values, and this has to
occur every time irrespective of where the clinician and the patient
come from; that is, irrespective of their presumed ‘culture’. In fact,
to continue to use the term culture to refer to a group can be
detrimental in that it may make the clinician think that he or she
understands the patient – that the patient is ‘Muslim’ or ‘Maori’ or
‘Irish’ – when that understanding may be no more than a stereotype and
hence a further obstacle to engaging with the other person's worldview.
To recap, the concept of culture is no longer useful for psychiatry; if
we understand culture as meanings and significances, then we need to
stay with those notions, the term ‘culture’ playing no useful part. If
we understand culture as referring to bounded groups, we would be
holding a discredited view of culture, and a view that may prevent
genuine engagement between clinicians and patients.

Against the motion, Rachel Bingham
==================================

A central conceptual struggle in psychiatry is the question of how to
define mental disorder, and thereby delineate the proper boundaries of
psychiatric practice. The concept of culture may arise in various ways;
for example, in drawing a distinction between religious experience and
psychopathology,(n.d.g) or between social deviance and mental
disorder.(n.d.h) Here, I will argue that the concept of culture is more
useful than ever. My argument, briefly, is that the boundary between
mental health and ill health is defined by values, and values arise from
culture; therefore, mental health and psychiatric practice cannot be
understood without attention to culture. Developing this, I suggest that
not only do values depend on culture, but values and culture overlap, or
partly constitute each other. Accordingly, to say something about a
person's culture is to say something about her values, and vice versa.
If so, the concept of culture should be considered vital to values-based
practice.(n.d.i)

The concept of culture is used here to refer to socially acquired
meanings that shape our experiences, our understandings of our
experiences, the behaviours of others and social events more broadly.
These shared meanings may influence not only when I believe myself to be
unwell and what response I consider is required, but may also shape my
experiences, actually contributing to whether or not I feel unwell or in
need of help in the given circumstances.(n.d.g) It is important not to
overstate the homogeneity of cultural meanings within a group. I may not
endorse all supposedly shared beliefs and values of all contexts I
inhabit, and it will be difficult to make predictions about my beliefs
and values by surveying the community in which I live. Nevertheless, I
will be affected by others’ beliefs and values – whether I endorse them,
unquestioningly go along with them, or even use my rejection of the
beliefs and values of my community as a springboard from which to find
my own way.

Values are integral to the concept of mental disorder, just as they are
to the concept of culture. Attempts to define mental disorder in purely
objective, factual terms have not been successful.(n.d.j) Distinctions
between mental disorder and mental health are irreducibly normative.
Facts alone cannot tell us which statistically extreme deviations, such
as genius or avarice, are pathological. Neither can facts alone tell us
what is functional or dysfunctional, as functions themselves are
relative to some valued outcome or purpose. Even if the neural
correlates were described for every item in a list of diagnosable mental
disorders, we would rely on values to decide the contents of that list.
Otherwise, we would merely have a list of states involving changes in
the brain, including, perhaps, love or criminality, with no further
directions as to which are the proper business of psychiatry.(n.d.k)

Values, then, are essential to the concept of mental disorder. And
values, as discussed, are not only influenced by culture, but contribute
to culture, and vice versa. But if so, why not abandon culture
altogether, as redundant, and focus only on what people value? Yet, to
focus only on values and not their context does not serve psychiatry
well. Whether values, meanings and interpretations are shared or not may
influence whether a particular experience is interpreted as illness, or
as some other unusual or distressing but essentially normal state. For
example, whether experiences such as fear or hearing voices are shared
and understood contributes to whether an individual is considered to be
gifted, possessed, well or unwell. In other words, the values and
beliefs of our community may partly constitute our experience of
illness. The extent to which these meanings are shared may even
determine whether or not a diagnosis is made.

In conclusion, among many uses of the concept of culture, one important
feature is to describe something other than scientific facts: something
essentially about values. Yet, psychiatry cannot focus only on values,
abandoning culture, because part of both the experience and the
diagnosis of mental health problems depends on the context – the shared
beliefs and meanings – in which values arise and develop. Accordingly we
need to see the practice of psychiatry as part of a wider context, as
happening in a time and place that influence how it proceeds. We need to
see our clients, patients, colleagues and ourselves as coming from
contexts that influence not only whether we experience distressing or
disabling symptoms, but also whether these symptoms are interpreted as
illness. Unless we can say this is really being done well, without the
need for further theoretical work, we cannot dispense with the concept
of culture.

For the motion, Norman A. Poole
===============================

As a neuropsychiatrically inclined psychiatrist, it might be assumed
that my reservations stem from a preference for biological explanations
in psychiatry. While there is something to be said for the role of
neuroimaging and biological investigations in psychiatry – for example,
the measurement of hippocampal volume and cerebrospinal fluid
beta-amyloid concentration in early stage Alzheimer's disease – they do
not satisfactorily address the motion, which, let us recall, is that
culture has outlived its usefulness for psychiatry. This is not to argue
that the focus on culture has hindered psychiatry. Indeed, the
transcultural psychiatrists have, among others, helped us to see that
biological reductionism is simplistic and wrong-headed. The diagnosis of
mental disorder is at the normative level,(n.d.l) just as the culturally
orientated psychiatrists claimed. Furthermore, transcultural psychiatry
has shown that what is deemed pathological in one culture need not be
viewed as such within another. Demon possession is considered abnormal
in the West, but this does not generalise to all other situations. What
is left to discuss? It appears I am at one with my opponents.

My reservation is that cross-cultural psychiatry prioritises difference
at the expense of universality, thereby exoticising mental disorder and
potentially alienating patients further. Those with so-called
culture-bound syndromes appear in the literature like new species of
tropical bird for the reader to gape and wonder at. Worse still is the
tendency, familiar to anyone who has worked in areas of diversity, for
clinicians with a smattering of mandatory ‘cross-cultural training’ to
dismiss unusual behaviour as ‘cultural’. I've heard this applied to
new-onset domestic violence and social withdrawal; cases of frontal
temporal dementia and schizophrenia, respectively, as it turned out.

Instead, I wish to present the view that what goes awry at the level of
norms and values is more universal than the transcultural psychiatrists
have supposed. Consider Pascal Boyer's notion of a folk psychiatry,
which is parasitical on what is called intuitive psychology.(n.d.m) That
is, the tendency to understand one's own and others' behaviour through
appeal to unobservable mental states such as beliefs, desires and
emotions, including their relation to one another. Most of this is done
at a level beneath conscious awareness; we become aware only of the
outcome. And our intuitive expectations of one another are composed of
domain-specific abilities rather than this being a general process.
While there are differences in explicit psychological models around the
world, the evidence from developmental psychology is that intuitive
abilities are universal; the best-known being theory of mind, which
occurs in all cultures studied to date.(n.d.n) Other tenets of intuitive
psychology include: mental states somehow represent or map the world as
it is; behaviour is internally generated; memory is a store of past
experience; communication follows tacit but constraining programmatic
principles, with each party endeavouring to ensure the other's ongoing
comprehension; a largely unconscious reading of others' subtle emotional
cues; and so on. That these develop in infancy implies they are more
universal than local. For instance, babies preferentially attend to
objects that appear to interact with one another, such as the Heider and
Simmel animation involving an ‘aggressive’ triangle and ‘fearful’ circle
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTNmLt7QX8E). No one, with the
exception of those with autism,(n.d.o) has any trouble in attributing
internal mental states to these shapes. Indeed, feelings of pity for the
circle are frequently evoked.

The idea is that mental disorder is implied when behaviour, including
verbal behaviour, contravenes one or more of our tacit expectations.
People with schizophrenia exhibit disordered thought and speech that
fails to follow the tacit rules of checking, repair, reducing ambiguity
and so forth, which are apparent to carers and fill the psychopathology
textbooks. It is important to note that this failure to meet the
expectations of intuitive psychology are not mere violations of social
norms – it is possible to behave in a socially unacceptable manner
without there being a corresponding difficulty with its
understandability. Repeat offenders are socially sanctioned, but few of
us have trouble attributing a motive to their crimes. Intuitive
psychology also seems to help sort the classic cross-cultural
psychiatric cases, without recourse to culture. The belief that one is
possessed by demons does not in the West seem to map or represent the
world accurately. There are, however, other accepted means for the
acquisition of belief; beliefs can also arise from the testimony of
others.(n.d.p) The belief that one is possessed by demons is accepted in
some cultures, because the belief is acquired from authority, i.e. the
rest of the group. This removes culture, because it is a fault with the
mechanism of belief acquisition that triggers suspicion of dysfunction
rather than the more general notion of a social norm being
contravened.(n.d.q)

To conclude, culture has outlived its usefulness for psychiatry because
it has misconceived the level at which things go wrong in mental
disorder. Those with mental disorder are not identified merely for
social deviancy but because some aspect of their behaviour fails to meet
the intuitive and universally held psychological expectations of others.
By focusing at this level, we are better able to appreciate what unites
us, both in sickness and in health.

Against the motion, Abdi Sanati
===============================

In what follows, I aim to show that culture is inseparable from
psychiatry, and that, in fact, psychiatry cannot be practised, or
conceived of, without culture. One can think of different ways to link
psychiatry and culture. One of the most basic ones is through language.
First, let us focus on the relationship between language and psychiatry.
One of the important, and in my opinion essential, elements of
psychiatry and its practice is psychopathology. It provides the
framework within which we define signs and symptoms of mental disorders
and communicate them to others. And language plays a necessary part in
this discipline. From an ontological point of view, I find it hard to
imagine the existence of delusions, verbal hallucinations and
obsessional thoughts without language. From an epistemological point of
view, to say any enquiry about human emotions is impoverished without
use of language is an understatement. Even describing purely behavioural
signs needs a language.

Now, I shall consider the relationship between language and culture.
Culture and society are inseparable. One of the integral elements in
every society is communication. Language is one of the most complex
means of communication and has enabled human society to achieve immense
complexity. The increase in the complexity of language contributed to
the increase in the complexity of the culture. The increase in
complexities of culture, in turn, feed back to make language more
complex. There are many other factors operating in this process; for
instance, I cannot deny the impact of technology on both culture and
language. However, there is a definite link between culture and
language. One can argue that while there is a definite association
between culture and language, this association is merely a contingent
one and it does not necessarily have to be the case. In the next step, I
shall argue that the association is indeed necessary; that is, without
culture we would not have language. Here, I rely on the work of Ludwig
Wittgenstein, especially his private language argument. Wittgenstein
explores whether there is a possibility of existence of a language which
is logically private; that is, it could be understandable only by one
person.(n.d.r) To clarify, it is not the possibility of a language that
someone like me can develop, which can be deciphered, but the
possibility of a language by someone who has been separate from others
since birth: a born Robinson Crusoe. This is different from development
of a new language by someone who already is a language speaker. That
person is already in possession of language skills, and the new language
would follow accepted rules. The Crusoe-type person in question does not
have any awareness of the rules of language and has to develop them from
scratch. In other words, this language is developed *de novo* in an
individual who has never been part of a community/culture. Wittgenstein
concludes that ‘a language in principle unintelligible to anyone but its
originating user is impossible. The reason for this is that such a
so-called language would, necessarily, be unintelligible to its supposed
originator too, for he would be unable to establish meanings for its
putative signs’.(n.d.s) Why would he be unable to do so? The answer lies
in Wittgenstein's description of language. According to Wittgenstein, to
understand a word is not to have a mental process signifying it. It is
knowing *how* to use the word. In other words, it is to know how to
follow the rules of using the words in different linguistic activities
such as questioning, asserting, joking, demanding, etc. Language is a
rule-governed activity. And to follow a rule one needs public criteria,
i.e. something outside oneself to objectively confirm that the rule is
followed. By objective, Wittgenstein does not mean that the rules are in
some way independent of our practice, something he asserted in his
earlier philosophy, but that what constitutes a rule is our collective
use of it. Rule-following is a general practice established by
agreement, custom and training.(n.d.t) He argues that the concept of
rule presupposes a custom. It is a cultural phenomenon. It cannot be
imagined to happen individually, independent of ‘historical groups of
individuals who are bound together into a community by a shared set of
complex, language-involving practices’.(n.d.u) There is a vital
connection between language and the complex set of practices and
activities that binds a community together. Language is interwoven into
the activities of the people and is fundamentally cultural in nature. In
other words, without culture there cannot be language and, hence, no
psychiatry.
