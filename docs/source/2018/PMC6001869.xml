All referrals made to the neuropsychiatry service at St George's Hospital over a 12-month period in 2014 were included.</p><p>We reviewed the referral forms and electronic patient records to extract information on demographics, reasons for referral, diagnoses, treatment plan, and number of contacts made. We identified the reasons for referral from the free text provided by the referrers. This requested information gives specific details about reasons for referral, presenting symptomology, referrers&#x02019; suspected diagnoses, previous psychiatric history and interventions, and management difficulties. Reasons for referral were grouped into categories, and more than one reason for each patient was allowed. The patient electronic records system used to record every contact with patients was also searched to retrieve the primary ICD-10 diagnoses for each patient. These results were then compared against those available in the published literature on neuropsychiatry and adult liaison psychiatry services referral patterns.</p><p>Those referred to the neuropsychiatry service from the acute neurology ward were compared against admission data for that ward to establish rates of referral. This was then contrasted with results from previous studies of this ward investigating the prevalence and rate of detection of mental disorder by neurologists. All clinicians involved in this study work within the clinical team and had access to patients' records as part of their role. Anonymised data were analysed and compared with previously published data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 129 referrals were identified in the year 2014. They were evenly dispersed across age groups, with a small peak in the age group 50&#x02013;59. The female:male ratio for referral was 1.35:1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.09). Almost 50% of the sample had a past psychiatric history. In terms of face-to-face contacts made, 32% received initial assessment only, 27% were seen twice, 15% were seen three times, and 10% were seen four times. The remaining 16% had four or more face-to-face contacts. The cumulative sum of all face-to-face contacts (first assessment and follow-up) was 311. Usually, the first assessments lasted 45&#x02013;75 minutes and 90% were seen within 2 working days of the date of referral. The highest rates of referral were during the months March, June, October and December.</p><p>Sixty per cent of referrals came from the regional in-patient neurology ward, 15% from neurosurgical wards, 9% from the stroke units, and 4% from the neuro-intensive care unit (NICU). The remainder were referred from other wards. Only 7% were made as urgent referrals. It was documented on 75% of forms that the referrer had discussed referral with the patient.</p><p>The most frequent cited reasons for referral were depression (50%), functional neurological symptoms or functional overlay (27%), anxiety (22%), cognitive decline or confusion (17%), agitation/aggression (13%), suicidal ideation or behaviour (12%), and psychotic symptoms (12%). Often, more than one reason for referral was provided; hence, the percentages do not total 100%. As a reason for referral, &#x02018;agitation&#x02019; was associated most with organic disorders, &#x02018;suicidal&#x02019; with adjustment disorder and organic mood disorder, and &#x02018;depression&#x02019; with mood disorders, adjustment disorder and &#x02018;no diagnosis&#x02019;. Functional symptoms/overlay were invariably associated with a psychiatric diagnosis of dissociative/conversion disorders. Almost all (91%) of the referred patients met the criteria for a psychiatric disorder according to ICD-10. The most common primary psychiatric diagnoses were: mood disorder (22%); dissociative disorder (18%); adjustment disorder (9%); delirium (5%); organic disorders (24%), including organic mood disorder (8.5%); and organic personality disorder (5%). In 9% of those referred, no mental disorder was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).

The age of referred patients was distributed evenly across the decades of life, with a small peak in the 20&#x02013;29 age group. The female:male ratio was 1.4:1. Initial assessment only was completed for 31%, while 27% were seen twice, 14% three times, and the remainder four times or more. Urgent referrals constituted 10% of all referrals from this ward, and 83% of referral forms had documented a discussion with the patient. Collectively, depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders represented the most frequent diagnoses (32%), followed by &#x02018;organic&#x02019; disorders (31%) and then somatoform disorders (21%). Most of those referred (81%) had a past history of psychiatric disorder. The majority of those patients diagnosed with dissociative disorders (70%) attended out-patient follow-up with our service following discharge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is a retrospective study of referrals from a regional neurology unit, which can come with its own limitations. Such a unit would generally have more complex neurological in-patients with a higher rate of neuropsychiatric comorbidity. However, the results of the present study and previously published papers are broadly comparable, suggesting no specific biases associated with our study population. The total number of referrals was small, despite the expected prevalence of psychiatric illnesses in neurological settings. This is in keeping with the low rates of identification of psychiatric comorbidity found in earlier prevalence studies. It may also suggest that neurology colleagues have a high threshold for referral to the psychiatric services. However, this implies that patients suspected to have psychiatric disorder were not referred to specialist services.</p><p>Our results show that patients referred to the team presented with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The rates of mental disorder in our sample did not match those in community<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> or general hospital<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> settings, demonstrating the distinctive nature of neuropsychiatric samples. The most common categories in our population were mood disorders, organic disorders and dissociative disorders, while the most common reasons for referrals were &#x02018;depression&#x02019; and &#x02018;functional neurological symptoms&#x02019;. Rates of disorder in our sample were close to those reported in previous studies,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> with a few differences.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> One difference is that depressive disorder accounted for 40% of referrals reported by Guthrie <italic>et al</italic> to their general liaison service that serves a large teaching hospital, but only 20% of our referrals received this diagnosis. Nevertheless, as for Guthrie <italic>et al</italic>, &#x02018;depression&#x02019; was the leading reason for referral to our service and the most common diagnosis in our sample. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders constituted a small portion of our workload, while they comprised one-third for Guthrie <italic>et al</italic>. Other significant differences were found in the rates of somatoform disorders (18.6 <italic>v.</italic> 2.6), organic disorders (24 <italic>v.</italic> 1.7), substance use disorders (4.8 <italic>v.</italic> 1.55) and personality disorders (0.7 <italic>v.</italic> 3.8), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>. Not unexpectedly, perhaps, our neuropsychiatry team was referred a higher proportion of organic disorders compared with the general hospital liaison service of Guthrie <italic>et al</italic>. It might be that neurologists perceive neuropsychiatrists as more willing and/or able to manage patients with organic psychiatric disorders than a liaison psychiatric service, such as that of Fitzgerald <italic>et al</italic>. Alternatively, because the Atkinson Morley Centre is a tertiary unit which admits complex neurological cases, there may be a higher percentage of organic psychiatric disorder in the population we serve. Another difference was the higher rate of dissociative disorders compared with liaison psychiatry teams, which again likely reflects that a tertiary neurology centre admits the most complex functional cases for thorough investigation and intervention &#x02013; especially as there is a dearth of neuropsychiatry services outside the London area. The unexpectedly low rate of substances misuse and personality disorders identified in our sample could reflect a reluctance to discuss these issues or an oddity of our population. Either way, this finding merits further evaluation. These variations will differentially influence the clinical expertise and practice of neuropsychiatrists and their colleagues in liaison psychiatry.

Utilising a battery of screening questionnaires followed by psychiatric interview Jeffries <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> identified a DSM-IV-defined mental disorder in 51.3% of 265 consecutive admissions during a period of 6 months.

This showed that neurologists recognised and documented symptoms of mental illnesses in 23.7% of all admissions, but referred fewer than half of these (10.4%), echoing our more recent findings (11.6%). Taken together, this demonstrates that 70&#x02013;80% of neurological patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder are not being referred to specialist services. Given the known impact of neuropsychiatric comorbidity on quality of life, duration of hospital stay, mortality, and cost of care, this may have a deleterious effect on those unable to access timely and effective psychiatric intervention.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Of those who were referred, analysis of the reason(s) for referral indicated strong correlation with the eventual confirmed diagnosis. The small number of patients who did not receive any diagnosis points to a low rate of false positives. Thus, it appears that neurology referrers were specific but not sensitive to identification of cases. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref> suggests that few patients with anxiety, adjustment disorders, personality disorders, and substance misuse disorders were referred, while referral was made for only a minority of those with depression and cognitive disorders. Appropriately, all those with psychotic disorders were referred, as were half the patients with somatoform disorders. Regarding patients with cognitive impairment, it may be that neurologists consider themselves capable of managing this patient group, as agitation was given as the main reason for the referral in all cases involving that problem.

Jonge suggested a referral procedure consisting of a short questionnaire to facilitate detection of caseness.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Likewise, Jeffries <italic>et al</italic> concluded that psychiatric screening questionnaires have a high sensitivity and specificity, thereby representing a cost-effective and acceptable method for improving identification of psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The intervening years have not lessened the arguments for this approach.
