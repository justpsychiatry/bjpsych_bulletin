The format was a combination of didactic teaching, role-play and DVD clips. It included a theoretical framework that explains attachment theory and how personality disorder and mentalising difficulties develop, as well as specific MBT techniques designed to strengthen both the patient's and the professional's ability to mentalise in stressful situations.

Data on the participants' professional groups were collected from five of the six training courses.</p><p>The main outcome measure was the Knowledge and Application of MBT Questionnaire (KAMQ; see Appendix 1) (A. Williams, C Cahill, J Patrick, personal communication, 2015). This 20-item questionnaire asks about knowledge of MBT (e.g. &#x02018;A key component of mentalising is thinking about people's attachment relationships&#x02019;) and how to apply MBT techniques, using a five-point Likert scale from &#x02018;strongly disagree&#x02019; to &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019;. A higher score indicated better knowledge of mentalising concepts and MBT techniques, with a maximum total score of 100 points. Work is currently in progress describing the development of this questionnaire and evaluating its psychometric properties.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p>The secondary measure was the Attitudes to Personality Disorder Questionnaire (APDQ; see Appendix 2), which measures clinicians' attitudes towards people with personality disorder. This questionnaire has 37 items that ask about the intensity of a person's feelings (e.g. &#x02018;I feel understanding towards people with personality disorder&#x02019;) using a six-point Likert scale, from &#x02018;never&#x02019; to &#x02018;always&#x02019;. A higher score indicated a more positive attitude, with a maximum score of 222 points. The APDQ has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.94) and test&#x02013;retest reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.71).<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data were entered into MS Excel by three authors (H.J.W., G.C. and C.M.M.). They were analysed by author T.C.R. using R for Windows 3.2.3. Linear regression was used to compute within-person change in score from baseline to end-of-programme for the KAMQ and APDQ separately. We used unadjusted models to explore the changes in scores over time and then constructed models adjusting for job category (whether different groups had differences in scores at baseline, i.e. had different intercepts) and an interaction term between job category and time (whether different professional groups were affected more than others over time, i.e. had different slopes). Effect sizes (Cohen's D) were calculated in order to examine the magnitude of difference between pre- and post-scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Missing data</title><p>An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.

Across all six courses, a total of 92 participants attended the first day of training and so were eligible for the study. All 92 were enrolled and completed the baseline questionnaires. Two participants attended the second day of training only and were excluded from the study.</p><p>Across all baseline questionnaires, 77 individual items (1.46% of the total baseline data) were left blank and imputed (mean) values inserted.</p><p>Across all completed end-of-programme questionnaires, 139 individual items (2.65% of the total end-of-programme data) were left blank. Eight end-of-programme questionnaires were not completed as the participant did not attend; this accounted for 8.69% of the total end-of-programme data. All end-of-programme missing data were treated in the same way, with their baseline scores being carried forward.</p><p>A <italic>post hoc</italic> power calculation suggested that our sample size of 92 at conventional levels of statistical significance (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05) would have 80% power to detect a small effect size (0.2).</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Data on professional groups</title><p>Data on professional groups were not collected for the first of the courses (June 2014) but were collected for all subsequent courses. The 74 participants whose job title was known were categorised according to professional background. The biggest group was nursing, representing 46 (62%) participants. The second largest group was psychology with 12 participants (16%), and the third largest was medical, with eight participants (11%). Other professional backgrounds included occupational therapist (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3), art therapist (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3), social worker (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1) and recreation assistant (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1).</p><p>For the regression analyses using professional groupings, we compared participants with medical and psychology backgrounds with those with a nursing background, to allow large enough samples for the analyses. The justification for combining these two groups was that there are likely to be parallels in the experience and training of participants with a medical and psychological background in relation to personality disorders. The comparison with participants from a nursing background was thought to be of interest.

Furthermore, this finding is in keeping with recent qualitative research that demonstrated that nursing staff who participated in an MBT-S course felt that it provided a &#x02018;straightforward but empowering skill set&#x02019; in working with patients with personality disorder.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>Attitudes to personality disorder improved overall to a lesser, albeit still statistically significant, degree. By definition, attitudes are somewhat engrained in someone's personality and professional way of working, so they may, of course, be hard to shift. It is interesting that in 27 cases, the APDQ scores worsened. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the intervention might have resulted in a genuine worsening of a minority of participants' attitudes towards personality disorder, we think it is plausible that this reflects participants' increased awareness and acceptance (i.e. mentalisation) of negative feelings towards patients (c.f. limitations of the study, below). Alternatively, this may represent an artefact of test&#x02013;retest reliability.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>We note the finding that doctors' and psychologists' APDQ scores improved less than those of nurses. Baseline APDQ scores were higher for doctors and psychologists, so it may be that we are seeing a &#x02018;ceiling effect&#x02019; &#x02013; there is less room to improve from a higher baseline. In the context of previous research,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> we think the salient point is that this intervention appeared to be effective for professional groups other than doctors in training.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2"><title>Comparison to other literature</title><p>The only other study to date to evaluate staff knowledge and application of MBT following MBT skills training was a pilot study that also demonstrated an improvement in KAMQ scores with large effect.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>A number of studies have assessed the effect of training on staff attitudes to personality disorder. In a randomised controlled study, Clarke <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> compared a psychoeducation programme with an intervention designed to help mental healthcare staff deal with the difficult feelings triggered by working with personality disorder patients (acceptance and commitment training). Participants had responded to an advertisement and volunteered for the free 2-day training. Both forms of training were found to significantly improve APDQ scores immediately post-training compared with baseline (based on their data, we have calculated Cohen's D to be 0.28 and 0.22 respectively), with no statistical difference between the two. The improvements were sustained at 6 months follow-up, although there was a high rate of drop-out resulting in a loss of statistical power.</p><p>A study assessing the effects of a 2-h personality disorder awareness workshop on prison staff (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) found no significant difference in APDQ scores before and 2 months after the training.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p>In a systematic review of interventions aimed at improving mental health nurses' skills, attitude and knowledge related to patients with BPD, Dickens <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> reviewed eight studies whose interventions ranged from a 90-min lecture to the complete 18-month intensive dialectical behaviour therapy training. None of these studies used the APDQ as an outcome measure. They found that changes in affective outcomes (including attitudes to personality disorder) were usually associated with small effect sizes, although changes in cognitive outcomes (including knowledge) were associated with larger effect sizes.</p><p>The outcomes of these studies indicate that these different forms of intervention have generally resulted in small improvements in participants' attitudes and emotional responses to personality disorder, but greater improvements in their knowledge relating to personality disorder. The ability to compare these outcomes with the present paper is limited owing to the use of different methodologies and the absence of studies that directly compare MBT-S with other interventions. Within this limitation, we note that the size of outcomes from the comparative literature mirror the results of the present intervention, MBT-S. This may confer preliminary support for the comparable efficacy of MBT-S.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the largest quantitative study to evaluate the effects of MBT-S on clinicians. Strengths of the study include the low study drop-out rate (8.7%) and the intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>One possible limitation is linked to the choice of questionnaire. The APDQ has no formal validity data, which limits the interpretation of our results. In addition, the APDQ relies on participants' reporting of feelings: the reporting of positive feelings is linked to a &#x02018;better&#x02019; attitude, while the reporting of negative feelings is linked to a &#x02018;worse&#x02019; attitude. Yet for clinicians, being aware of negative feelings towards patients is likely to be helpful, as it gives them a chance to consider and reflect on their responses, and makes them less likely to act on feelings in a counter-therapeutic way.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> A lower APDQ may not, therefore, indicate a less helpful clinician stance, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Work is needed to establish benchmarks for the KAMQ &#x02013; i.e. what constitutes a &#x02018;good&#x02019; level of knowledge about mentalising.</p><p>That the training was delivered by two of the study's authors introduces the risk of bias. Data entry and analysis were performed by authors who had no role in the delivery or running of the courses, limiting this risk. Some individual participants and mental health teams self-selected to attend the training, which introduces a potential confounding factor. The internal validity would be improved by having a control group. This would pose some practical problems, not least the challenge of providing a convincing 2-day &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; training. An alternative would be to have a practice-as-usual control group, who only complete the outcome measures.</p><p>There has so far been no longitudinal follow-up of the study's participants. Therefore, we cannot comment on whether the effects of training persist.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4"><title>Research and clinical practice implications</title><p>Our study suggests that MBT skills teaching is a good way of improving staff knowledge about mentalising skills and is accessible to different professional groups. That attitudes to personality disorder improved overall is also encouraging in relation to the possibility of deeper learning in staff.</p><p>Our findings add weight to the need for a larger study of MBT-S that uses both staff and patient outcomes and incorporates a control group. We note the importance of follow-up beyond the intervention to investigate whether effects persist; accordingly, follow-up is planned. Future research should aim to establish the potential influence of teaching mentalising skills on &#x02018;real world&#x02019; clinical work, such as better therapeutic relationships or reductions in self-harming behaviour.
