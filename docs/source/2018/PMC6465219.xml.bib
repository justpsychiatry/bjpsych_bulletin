This book is the fruition of an idea by the author that has germinated
since the 1970s. It was largely inspired by his concern with unfair
discrimination against people with mental illness. From its evocative
title to its thought-provoking review of 200 years of mental health
legislation (both in the UK and globally), this is a book that should
appeal to a wide audience. It has been deliberately written to include
patients and family (‘experts by experience’) as part of a
multidisciplinary audience. The fluent and conversational writing style,
the purposeful use of ‘typical’ case histories, the text being well
signposted with subheadings, and references being readily accessible at
the end of each chapter certainly help in this respect.

There are two main themes – the use of coercion in mental health
practice and an equally interesting bold and well-thought-out exposition
of a proposed new mental health legislation termed a ‘Fusion law’. This
law is non-discriminatory and generic for all specialties, with no need
for specific mental health law, the framework being based on
decision-making capability and a modified best interests approach to
involuntary admissions and treatment decisions.

The book has five parts and comprises 13 chapters. Part I considers
problems associated with involuntary detention, which the author
believes actually contributes towards discrimination against people with
mental illness. Part II offers an exciting solution to involuntary
detention and treatment and proposes in-depth new legislation. This part
has a more theoretical or academic feel, but this is where the author
elucidates and validates his proposed reforms. A visual flowchart of
these reforms may have been helpful to help understand these better. The
author does acknowledge that there would need to be some initial interim
measures in the forensic setting were these reforms enacted. Part III
analyses coercion and treatment pressures in everyday clinical practice
and provides ideas to try and reduce recourse to coercive measures in
both detaining and treating people. This part would be particularly
useful for junior doctors of all specialties. Parts IV and V are about
translating the theoretical basis of new reforms into the reality of
clinical practice across all physical and mental health settings.

Given that mental health law has not fundamentally changed for around
200 years (essentially still being based on the two criteria of having a
mental disorder and posing a risk of harm, but *not* including any form
of capacity criteria) it would surely be an epoch-making quantum leap in
mental health legislation to enact this Fusion law. However, the author
opines that ‘change is now essential’ and is optimistic that such
legislation favouring patient empowerment will continue to emerge
globally, citing a version of Fusion law and its principles having been
passed in the Northern Ireland Mental Capacity Bill 2016. This was an
invigorating read, challenging the long-held orthodoxy of mental health
law. It is a text that will surely resonate with all clinicians involved
in the application of the Mental Health Act.
