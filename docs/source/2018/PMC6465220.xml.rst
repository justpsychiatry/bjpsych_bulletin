I quite understand Jennifer Smith's concern. It seems, on the face of
it, silly to suggest that the age of consent be reduced when the great
majority of people, including me, think it is unwise for adolescents to
engage in full sexual intercourse at least until their late teens. But,
once one has considered how the existing law is flouted, it no longer
seems at all silly. The idea that changing the law will encourage
50-year-old men to seduce 14-year-olds rather than 16-year-olds seems
highly improbable. The reality is that the best safeguards against
premature sexual activity are those that emphasise much better sex
education for children and young people who would thus be empowered to
say ‘no’. And lowering the age of sexual consent would allow parents and
teachers to engage in imparting meaningful information earlier than is
currently the case.
