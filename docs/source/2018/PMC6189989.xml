Instead, formulation was used to describe the participant's presentation at the time. The term emotional difficulties was used to capture these cases.</p><p>Some disorders were grouped into categories. Hyperkinetic disorder, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were classified together as externalising disorders. Generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder (OCD) and phobic disorders were classified together as anxiety disorders. Different forms of substance misuse were categorised as mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use. These disorders were grouped in this way because of their level of comorbidity within the category. No diagnosis of conduct disorder or ODD presented without comorbid hyperkinetic disorder. Phobic disorder and OCD did not present as single anxiety disorders. Those participants who misused substances, misused at least two. Therefore, we could not make conclusions regarding an individual diagnosis transition for those individual disorders. Listing all the individual disorders led to a multitude of combinations within the categories and a pragmatic decision was made to group the disorders.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Support for this research was obtained from the Research and Development Department within Cwm Taf University Health Board, which is responsible for both the AMHS and CAMHS clinical records.

Of the disorders diagnosed by CAMHS, 64 were no longer present after participants transferred to AMHS, and 100 new disorders were diagnosed in AMHS. Of the 98 participants, 23 (23%) had no changes to their diagnosis.</p><p>Disorders diagnosed in CAMHS were examined retrospectively, observing how these cases developed diagnostically under AMHS. Heterotypic continuity was observed to be significant in three disorder categories. These categories were CAMHS externalising disorders to dissocial personality disorders (DPP) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01), CAMHS eating disorders to emotionally unstable personality disorders (EUPD) (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01) and CAMHS emotional difficulties to EUPD (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). Homotypic continuity was evident for externalising disorders (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37.5, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), neurotic disorders (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.04, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01), bipolar affective disorder (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), pervasive developmental disorder (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), mental and behavioural disorder due to psychoactive substance use (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01) and Tourette's syndrome (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). Several disorders displayed an inverse relationship and, if present in CAMHS, the presence of other disorders in AMHS decreased. This was the case for the following diagnoses: CAMHS neurotic disorder and AMHS externalising disorder (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.47, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02), CAMHS externalising disorders with both AMHS neurotic disorders (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.02, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03) and EUPD (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8.07, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), and CAMHS depression and AMHS externalising disorder (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.08, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02).</p><p>There were two new cases of schizophrenia in the AMHS sample. The participants had diagnoses of emotional difficulties and externalising disorder while under CAMHS. Of the three new cases of bipolar affective disorder, one participant had a diagnosis of externalising disorder and two had a diagnosis of depression while under CAMHS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our sample, the majority of participants experienced a change in diagnosis between adolescence and adulthood. The aim of this study was to explore the patterns of this change. A total of 59% of participants recovered from their CAMHS diagnosis, indicating effective treatment or evolving symptoms. After transitioning to AMHS, 75% of all participants had been diagnosed with a new diagnosis. This highlights that comorbidity and complexity is still developing.</p><p>Cwm Taf University Health Board has an agreed transition policy between CAMHS and AMHS. Since 2011, patients are referred from CAMHS when they are 17.5 years old. A period of transition is then expected, with joint clinical reviews, until the patient reaches the age of 18. Prior policies recommended the transfer to adult services at age 16 or when formal education ended. Previous research has indicated that only 49% of CAMHS patients that have reached the age of service transition successfully engage with AMHS.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> If these individuals had a history of severe mental illness, prescriptions or previous admissions they were more likely to transition. Our study includes people who have been assessed and diagnosed by both CAMHS and AMHS. In this context, it is therefore difficult to establish if the sample is representative as comparable research has mostly been done on a population level. This may explain why several disorders displayed an inverse relationship although research indicates a comorbid relationship.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In our sample, externalising disorders were more prevalent than depression. This is a possible explanation for the higher proportion of male participants in our sample.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> This is important as females are at a higher risk for adolescent mental illness continuing into adulthood<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and are more likely to develop comorbid mental disorders than males.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>Homotypic continuity into adulthood was statistically present for several disorders, including externalising disorders. This was an expected finding as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder has an accepted degree of diagnostic stability, continuing into adulthood with population rates ranging from 1.2 to 7.3%.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Neurotic disorders also continued into adulthood. This supports research showing adolescent depression and neurotic disorders displaying a modest continuity into adulthood, in a relapsing and remitting pattern.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This pattern may have influenced why neurotic disorders, but not depression, showed homotypic continuity in this cross-sectional study. Homotypic continuity was also evident for bipolar disorder. Despite this being a small sample, the finding is in keeping with research showing bipolar disorder to be relatively stable diagnostically.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Homotypic continuity was also present for pervasive developmental disorder. This is to be expected as it is considered a lifelong diagnosis.</p><p>All CAMHS participants with anorexia nervosa had recovered, and 60% developed EUPD. The DSM defines borderline personality disorder (BPD) instead of EUPD. As EUPD and BPD are comparable, research into both disorders may provide insights into their relationship with eating disorders. Eating disorders have been reported in histories of people with BPD at a rate of 54%, a percentage comparable with our findings.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Difficulty in mood regulation, less distress tolerance and a history of childhood emotional abuse are shared findings for these disorders.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Identifying such shared characteristics may be the key to developing an understanding of which individual's disorders progress and which resolve.</p><p>Within the EUPD population in AMHS, six participants (50%) had a history of emotional difficulties in their childhoods. In the ICD-10, diagnostic categories separate children and adults at times. It could therefore be argued that homotypic continuity be considered despite a change in diagnosis. However, we would argue the existence of these age-related restrictions highlights that symptoms are different at different developmental stages. It is important to note that no diagnostic criteria for child- or adult-specific disorders are the same, minus the age restriction. For this reason, CAMHS emotional difficulties progressing to AMHS EUPD was considered a heterotypic transition. Similarly, externalising disorders transitioning to DPD was considered a heterotypic transition. This is despite the frequency of this particular diagnostic transition.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Research has shown that particular traits make the transition to DPD more frequent.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> These traits include persistent conduct problems and engaging in more victim-orientated and violent offences. In our sample, 15% of CAMHS externalising disorders progressed to DPD. All of these participants were initially diagnosed with conduct disorder. As antisocial behaviour peaks in adolescence, this could be considered the ideal time to target intervention, especially as research indicates poor outcomes when antisocial behaviour is related to conduct disorder and substance misuse.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p><p>Two cases of adolescent depression developed into bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is commonly diagnosed within the first 5 years after the first depressive episode.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> This time frame highlights diagnostic progression during the transition to adulthood. Prodromal syndromes, preceding schizophrenia, are also often associated with this epoch. These non-specific changes to a person's mental state are often assumed to be normal behaviour or mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> It is debatable as to whether these adolescent diagnoses should be seen as displaying heterotypic change or are better characterised as prodromal syndromes. Although prodromal symptoms may be present in the childhoods of people with schizophrenia, diagnosable mental health difficulties may also be present. It is hoped that further research in this area will benefit from the DSM-5 (2013) inclusion of attenuated psychosis syndrome.</p><p>This study has highlighted patterns of disorder transition as individuals move from adolescence to adulthood. A developmental perspective of mental illness would postulate that these disorders develop from common vulnerabilities, displaying different symptoms at different developmental stages.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Research has also indicated diagnostic transition peaks in adolescence and early adulthood.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Future research, focusing on adolescence and young adulthood as the formative years for mental health, could facilitate an early identification of individuals at risk and the development of targeted interventions.</p><p>Owing to this study's sample size, there is a limit on how generalisable the results are to other mental health teams. This study also contained young people, on average aged 18, and over half had transitioned within 2 years. Follow-up until the mid-twenties may have better captured the diagnostic change during the at-risk period of early adulthood.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> It is assumed that the standard of practice would have been similar among the CAMHS professionals as they worked for the same organisation and used the same diagnostic criteria, and the same is assumed for the AMHS professionals. However, bias may have been introduced into this study during the transition from CAMHS and AMHS. CAMHS services were developed using the Common Assessment Framework or the Choice and Partnership Approach, with a focus on formulation. Care and Treatment Plans, with a diagnostic focus, were more common in AMHS. In Wales, both teams are now required to produce a Care and Treatment Plan in keeping with Part 2 of the Mental Health Measure.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This was made law in 2012 and one of the key aims is that it would improve consistency. As this study captures a predominately earlier cohort, it would be interesting to see if legislation has had its desired effect and if bias in diagnosis is now less of a concern. In our opinion, further research would benefit from a larger sample size, longer follow-up and structured interviews by blinded researchers.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="other" id="nts1"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Ann Collins</bold> is a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Speciality Registrar at the Tonteg Child and Family Clinic, Cwm Taf University Health Board, Pontypridd, Wales, UK. <bold>Antonio Mu&#x000f1;oz-Solomando</bold> is a Consultant Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Psychiatrist at the Tonteg Child and Family Centre, Cwm Taf University Health Board, Pontypridd, Wales, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Costello</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Copeland</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Angold</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name>
