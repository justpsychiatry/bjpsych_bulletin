   The influence of pharmaceuticals on the environment is an increasing
   concern among environmental toxicologists. It is known that their
   growing use is leading to detectable levels in wastewater,
   conceivably causing harm to aquatic ecosystems. Psychotropic
   medication is one such group of substances, particularly affecting
   high-income countries. While these drugs have a clear place in
   therapy, there is debate around the risk/benefit ratio in patients
   with mild mental health problems. Therefore, it is necessary to
   evaluate the wider implications as risks could extend beyond the
   individual to non-target organisms, particularly those in rivers and
   estuaries.

Psychotropic drug use patterns
==============================

Adequate psychiatric service provision is central to health and quality
of life, and the use of psychotropic medication can be invaluable in the
treatment and management of mental health problems. The uses of these
drugs have been evident since their introduction, and they have a
well-established place in clinical practice. However, within the medical
fields, there has been a debate in recent years about the over-reliance
on drugs such as antidepressants, antianxiety drugs and
antipsychotics.1\ :sup:`–`\ 4 Data from a number of countries have
indicated rapid rises in prescriptions, with as many as 10% of the
population taking such medications, particularly in high-income
countries such as the UK.3 Within the field of environmental toxicology,
the effects of these drugs have recently started to generate some
interest too.

Pharmaceuticals as emergent pollutants
======================================

Currently, pharmaceuticals mainly enter the environment through
wastewater after their excretion, either in their original form or as
metabolites. This has long been known,5\ :sup:`,`\ 6 with the first
reports of these substances entering the environment dating back to the
1960s.7 However, sewage treatment plant processes do not adequately
remove pharmaceuticals. With the sheer number of different medications
being prescribed and the inability of even quite modern sewage treatment
processes to fully break them down, it could be argued that our aquatic
life is bathing in a soup of multiple drugs.

Toxicity levels of pharmaceuticals in the environment do not necessarily
relate to high concentrations, but to their constant low-level
discharge, persistence in ecosystems and highly active biological
functions. In this way, pharmaceuticals that are found in relatively low
concentrations could be extremely potent and very persistent, and able
to significantly affect non-target organisms. For example, low
concentrations of antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs can cause
disruption to the normal functioning of aquatic organisms.8

The concept of environmental relevance, therefore, becomes important.
For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective
serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, serotonin antagonist
reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines have
all been detected in urbanised waterways, mostly in the ng/L range, but
also in concentrations up to μg/L.7 What is particularly starting to
interest scientists is that these antidepressants can cause disruption
to the normal functioning of aquatic life in laboratory experiments at
low concentrations. The uptake of these compounds appears to be highly
dependent on the organism's mode of feeding.9 In terms of presence in
the environment, for example, diazepam has been found in all matrices –
wastewater, surface, ground and drinking water, soils, bio-solids and
tissues10 – and in concentrations as high as 10 ng/L in rivers and
potable water.11

Pharmaceuticals are not present in isolation in the environment, and the
widespread high use of a wide variety of drugs leads to multiple
substances being found together, in a situation where synergistic or
antagonistic effects can occur.7 In addition, exposure of some
non-target organisms to these substances takes place for the entirety of
their life cycle.12 Currently, pharmaceuticals and their active
metabolites are globally considered to be an important emergent group of
pollutants that are intrinsically bioactive, causing adverse drug
reactions and previously undocumented effects on non-target organisms.7

The effects of psychotropic drugs on the aquatic environment
============================================================

The notion that drugs prescribed to humans might be affecting wildlife
first came to light in the 1990s, when scientists highlighted that
natural and synthetic oestrogens from contraceptive pills and hormone
replacement therapy in wastewater effluent could feminise fish at very
low concentrations.13 Growing incidences of reproductive and other
abnormalities developed into an interdisciplinary field, linking human
and environmental toxicology to the study of endocrine-disrupting
chemicals. As improved analytical techniques become available and
interest in this field increases, the influence of pharmaceuticals on
the environment is increasingly being documented. Identified cases where
pharmaceuticals are causing detrimental effects are therefore becoming
more common. For example, the veterinary use of the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac has recently been linked to widespread
(over 90%) declines in vulture species in some countries14 and serves as
a reminder that, sometimes, the effects of biologically active drugs can
have far-reaching consequences.

While the potential for pharmaceuticals to lead to toxicity in
non-target organisms exists across all therapeutic groups, the case of
psychotropic medication is particularly concerning. This is because
these drugs, which are among the most commonly detected in aquatic
environments, affect not only the central nervous system but are also
linked with reproduction, growth and immune functions.13\ :sup:`,`\ 15
In this way, psychotropic drugs such as antidepressants modulate
neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, having multiple
physiological effects in humans such as weight gain, fatigue and sexual
dysfunction.

The ability of psychotropic medication to disrupt the normal biological
systems of abundant and ecologically important groups of non-target
organisms in aquatic environments is extensive. Since reuptake
transporters and receptors evolved in invertebrates such as molluscs and
Crustacea, release of neurohormones would be expected to have multiple
biological effects on these invertebrates, in addition to vertebrates
such as fishes. Therefore, any compounds in the environment at a
sufficient concentration able to alter neurohormones have the capacity
to affect a wide range of biological processes,16 leading to salient
effects on critical life cycle events. Processes affected include
reproduction, growth, maturation, metabolism, immunity, feeding,
locomotion, colour physiology and behaviour. Examples of adverse effects
that have been observed include photo- and geotactic behaviour, abnormal
activity patterns, aggressive behaviour, developmental and metabolic
abnormalities, and reproductive abnormalities. Interestingly, some of
these effects are only exhibited at low concentrations, rather than
being dose dependent as may have been expected.16

For example, Guler and Ford17 studied the effects of a variety of
pharmaceuticals and the hormone serotonin on the preference for light
versus dark choice chambers in amphipods. They reported a significant
preference for light and response to gravity in terms of position in
amphipods exposed to fluoxetine and serotonin. The dose response was
linear for serotonin, whereas for fluoxetine the response was not dose
dependent and the behaviour was induced only at lower concentrations
(10–100 ng/L). Similarly, when crabs were injected with serotonin,
photonegative behaviour was reduced and they spent substantially less
time hidden.16 This would have consequences for aquatic life, as
preference to light has been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of
predation.

Other studies found that while 1 ng/L fluoxetine influenced learning in
the cuttlefish, 100 ng/L did not, but did significantly influence the
retention of memory. Effects observed include fluoxetine influencing on
learning and memory in cuttlefishes at concentrations between 1 and
100 ng/L.18 Swimming activity has been observed to be altered in
amphipod crustaceans at levels as low as 1–100 ng/L,19 and gonadal
aberrations in zebra mussels have been induced in ranges as low as
20 ng/L. Moreover, fluvoxamine was found to induce egg deposition in
zebra mussels at ~318 ng/L,20 and exposure to venlafaxine has caused
foot detachment (an inability to cling to the side of a tank) at levels
as low as 313 pg/L and 31.3 ng/L.21\ :sup:`,`\ 22 Further effects on
reproductive output in terms of frequency of broods, offspring
production, gamete release and gene expression have been demonstrated in
the ng/L concentrations.

Induction of hyperglycaemic responses in a variety of crustaceans has
also been observed. The regulation of blood glucose through crustacean
hyperglycaemic hormone is under the control of a variety of
neurohormones.23 There have also been reports that dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline and adrenaline are all effective in inducing
hyperglycaemic responses in a variety of crustaceans.24 The release of
crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone has been shown to be promoted by
injection with serotonin in a variety of species.23 Interestingly,
studies with crabs have shown that both serotonin and fluoxetine can
stimulate crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone and suppress moulting
hormones.25 In terms of pigmentation, serotonin has been shown to
influence red pigment-dispersing hormone, while dopamine influences red
and black pigment-concentrating hormones in shrimp. It has also been
found that noradrenaline triggers release of black pigment-dispersing
hormone.23 Therefore, any drugs with the capability to modulate these
neurohormones can conceivably interfere with the camouflage abilities of
aquatic invertebrates.

Perhaps it is not surprising that fish exposed to antidepressants or
antianxiety medication display altered behaviours when one considers how
evolutionarily conserved the nervous system is among the vertebrates.
Furthermore, because of this conserved ancestry, fish are now more
commonly used in drug discovery, with behavioural tests commonly used in
rats and mice being translated to fish models.26\ :sup:`,`\ 27 For
example, the novel tank test measures the ‘normal’ reluctance of a fish
to venture in the open surroundings of a new tank, which can be altered
by antianxiety medication.28\ :sup:`,`\ 29 Other studies within the
field of environmental toxicology have observed a wide range of altered
behaviours in fish, including aggression towards
conspecifics,30\ :sup:`,`\ 31 reproduction,32\ :sup:`,`\ 33 predator
avoidance34 and feeding.35

A body of evidence is therefore building which suggests that
antidepressants in particular, at concentrations found in surface, waste
and ground waters, can cause a wide variety of effects. Whether these
are occurring in the field downstream of wastewater treatment plants
(WWTPs) represents an important and challenging question to address, as
the ability to measure abnormal behaviour *in situ* remains a logistical
and technological challenge. Moreover, while the underlying role of
neurotransmitters has been described in vertebrates, there is
considerable paucity of data on their role in invertebrates.16 The
non-monotonic dose responses shown by some
drugs,17\ :sup:`,`\ 18\ :sup:`,`\ 36\ :sup:`–`\ 38 for which
pharmacological effects are not dose dependent and a response is
triggered by a low concentration, with no response to higher
concentrations, poses questions which are difficult to ignore.39 While
some studies have been conducted on the toxicology of antidepressants
such as fluoxetine,16 these are few and far between. Given the evidence
on the influence of pharmaceuticals, particularly psychotropic drugs, on
the environment, it can be argued that greater emphasis should be placed
on how they may be affecting aquatic life.

The solutions
=============

The solutions to these problems, as might be expected, are
multifactorial and somewhat influenced by historical decisions. For
example, some WWTPs may have historically serviced small towns and
villages which later grew in population into large towns and cities. If
these WWTPs historically discarded their effluent into small (low flow)
rivers, then the effluent to river water ratios could change over time.
Changes in water usage upstream, for example, water extraction for
farming, could further confound the problem. Advanced treatment at
wastewater treatment facilities would reduce many of the potentially
harmful pharmaceuticals waste products and their breakdown metabolites.
Where technological improvements of sewage treatment have been
implemented, there have been reductions in intersex (feminised) fish
caused by steroid oestrogens and their mimics, as well as improvements
in river biodiversity.40\ :sup:`,`\ 41 These improvements, however, are
costly. Owen and Jobling (2012)42 estimated that upgrading all the WWTPs
in England and Wales to comply with EU regulation to bring synthetic
oestrogens below an average of 0.035 pg/L ethinylestradiol per annum
would cost an estimated £26 billion.

Another solution to this complex problem is to change behaviours whereby
people would traditionally flush their unwanted medications down the
toilet or dispose of them in the bin. ‘Take back’ programmes vary in
their popularity across Europe, but serve as one means to prevent
unwanted medication entering aquatic systems directly following
wastewater treatment or indirectly through underground seepage from
landfills. The question of green pharmacy has also been raised, whereby
the pharmaceutical industry considers the cradle-to-grave approach of
their products and designs drugs which readily break down. However, this
is extremely difficult to achieve for most drugs, owing to the need to
produce pharmacologically active pharmaceuticals in suitable
formulations.43

Reflections for policy and practice
===================================

Mental healthcare services are provided through complex systems, which
are generally based around the use of medication, with training in
psychiatry covering vast areas to enable the provision of quality care
to patients. However, there is no inclusion of aspects of pollution and
the effects of psychotropic medication, and how this could affect
aquatic environments. Could educating the medical profession help
improve the utility of take back programmes and patient behaviour with
regard to drug waste? These substances are not currently covered by
existing regulations with regards to sewage management, and analytical
methods for detection are just now becoming available. Adequate
resources for the diagnosis and management of mental health conditions
could help reduce the need for medication and the documented toxic
effects of the use of these drugs on non-target organisms. ‘Prescribing’
psychotropic medication for our rivers and estuaries poses a potential
risk to aquatic life. Further knowledge and education on adequate
therapeutic choices, and improved resources for diagnosis, could support
prescribers and practitioners to make environmentally sensible choices,
based on evidence of efficacy and safety.44
