Our study was also limited to participants being admitted to a single unit. Finally, the study was conducted during the winter months; thus, the reported prevalence of vitamin D deficiency would be affected by sun exposure if the study was conducted towards the end of summer.</p><p>Based on this study, in which almost half of the participants admitted to psychiatric hospital were found to be deficient in vitamin D, assessment and treatment of vitamin D deficiency by oral supplementation should be considered to protect musculoskeletal health, alongside other physical health interventions, in patients with mental illness admitted to psychiatric wards.</p><p>The NHS Five Year Forward View for mental health has recognised the importance of preventable physical health problems in people with severe mental illness,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and thus musculoskeletal health should be optimised where possible.</p><p>At the current time, there is insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions regarding an association between vitamin D deficiency and non-musculoskeletal health outcomes, including mental illness. More research in the form of larger epidemiological and intervention studies are needed to investigate the association between vitamin D and mental health outcomes; indeed, randomised controlled trials are planned that will hopefully shed more light on this intriguing area in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr David Clarke, Operational Lead (Research and Development), Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, for his invaluable support and guidance.</p></ack><notes notes-type="other" id="nts1"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Dipen Patel</bold> is a clinical fellow in Psychiatry and <bold>Manjunath Minajagi</bold> is a Consultant Psychiatrist at Bradgate Mental Health Unit, Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, Leicester, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Lips</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name>
