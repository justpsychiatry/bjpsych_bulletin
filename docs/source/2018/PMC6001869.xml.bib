      :name: sec_a1

   Psychiatric disorders are common in neurological in-patients, but
   they are under-recognised and undertreated. We investigated the
   frequency of detection of mental disorder and referral to psychiatric
   services in a regional neuroscience centre. The results were compared
   with the expected prevalence. All in-patient referrals received in
   2014 from the in-patient wards of the regional neuroscience centre
   and acute neurological unit were reviewed.

   .. rubric:: Results
      :name: sec_a3

   A total of 129 ward referrals were identified; of these, 78 were from
   the regional in-patient neurological unit, which comprised 11.4% of
   the total of 679 admissions to that unit.

   .. rubric:: Clinical implications
      :name: sec_a4

   A spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions were recognised by
   neurologists, but overall rates of recognition were low. To address
   the problem of under-recognition, routine screening with validated
   assessment tools can represent a cost-effective and acceptable method
   to detect psychiatric disorders in an in-patient neurological
   setting.

Liaison neuropsychiatry is an important element of psychiatric care in
neurological in-patients, given the severity and complexity of the cases
involved.(n.d.a) Yet there is a dearth of information about consultation
rates, presentation, diagnoses, and interventions that would improve
access to services, facilitate evidence-based practice, and articulate
the relationship between neurological and psychiatric
disorders.(n.d.b)\ :sup:`–`\ (n.d.c)

Previous estimates of psychiatric comorbidity in neurological settings
have revealed high prevalence rates. For example, the overall rate of
psychiatric disorder in neurological out-patient clinics has been
reported as 55.1%,(n.d.d) the most frequent diagnoses being somatoform
disorders, which represented 33.8% of the sample. Similarly, the
prevalence in an acute in-patient neurological unit was 51.3%.(n.d.e) It
appears, therefore, that psychiatric comorbidity is high in neurological
settings. This is to be expected, given the elevated rates of
psychiatric comorbidity in neurological disorders. Patients with
cerebrovascular and Parkinson's disease have prevalence of depression
that ranges between 20 and 40%.(n.d.f)\ :sup:`,`\ (n.d.g) Functional
neurological symptoms are also common in neuroscience settings; it has
been reported that 14% of consecutive neurological admissions had no
so-called ‘organic’ bases for their symptoms, while another 24% had
symptoms not fully accounted for by the underlying pathology.(n.d.h)

Neuropsychiatric conditions in neurological in-patients, if undetected
or not adequately managed, are associated with poor quality of life,
greater morbidity, mortality and poor psychosocial outcomes.(n.d.i)
Moreover, there are specific neuropsychiatric presentations associated
with common neurological conditions that pose diagnostic, nosological
and management challenges, which require the unique clinical skills of
neuropsychiatrists. These conditions may include schizophrenia-like
psychosis of epilepsy, forced normalisation,(n.d.j) organic personality
changes or organic mood disorders,(n.d.k) to name a few. This highlights
the need for the development and implementation of structured care
pathways for the neuropsychiatric comorbidities associated with
neurological conditions.(n.d.l)

Despite these high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, surveys
investigating referrals from neurology wards to neuropsychiatric liaison
services have demonstrated unexpectedly low rates of referral.
Fitzgerald *et al* and Jonge *et al* found that only 6% and 2.4% of
neurology in-patients, respectively, were referred to liaison
neuropsychiatry.(n.d.m)\ :sup:`,`\ (n.d.n) The present study sought to
investigate the rates of referral to an established neuropsychiatry
service in a tertiary neurosciences centre, in order to better
understand referral patterns and rates of recognition of mental disorder
in neurological in-patients.

Method
======

This study was conducted at the Atkinson Morley Regional Neurosciences
Centre at St George's Hospital, London, covering a population of 3
million residents of South West London and Surrey. All referrals made to
the neuropsychiatry service at St George's Hospital over a 12-month
period in 2014 were included.

We reviewed the referral forms and electronic patient records to extract
information on demographics, reasons for referral, diagnoses, treatment
plan, and number of contacts made. We identified the reasons for
referral from the free text provided by the referrers. This requested
information gives specific details about reasons for referral,
presenting symptomology, referrers’ suspected diagnoses, previous
psychiatric history and interventions, and management difficulties.
Reasons for referral were grouped into categories, and more than one
reason for each patient was allowed. The patient electronic records
system used to record every contact with patients was also searched to
retrieve the primary ICD-10 diagnoses for each patient. These results
were then compared against those available in the published literature
on neuropsychiatry and adult liaison psychiatry services referral
patterns.

Those referred to the neuropsychiatry service from the acute neurology
ward were compared against admission data for that ward to establish
rates of referral. This was then contrasted with results from previous
studies of this ward investigating the prevalence and rate of detection
of mental disorder by neurologists. All clinicians involved in this
study work within the clinical team and had access to patients' records
as part of their role. Anonymised data were analysed and compared with
previously published data.

Results
=======

A total of 129 referrals were identified in the year 2014. They were
evenly dispersed across age groups, with a small peak in the age group
50–59. The female:male ratio for referral was 1.35:1 (*P* = 0.09).
Almost 50% of the sample had a past psychiatric history. In terms of
face-to-face contacts made, 32% received initial assessment only, 27%
were seen twice, 15% were seen three times, and 10% were seen four
times. The remaining 16% had four or more face-to-face contacts. The
cumulative sum of all face-to-face contacts (first assessment and
follow-up) was 311. Usually, the first assessments lasted 45–75 minutes
and 90% were seen within 2 working days of the date of referral. The
highest rates of referral were during the months March, June, October
and December.

Sixty per cent of referrals came from the regional in-patient neurology
ward, 15% from neurosurgical wards, 9% from the stroke units, and 4%
from the neuro-intensive care unit (NICU). The remainder were referred
from other wards. Only 7% were made as urgent referrals. It was
documented on 75% of forms that the referrer had discussed referral with
the patient.

The most frequent cited reasons for referral were depression (50%),
functional neurological symptoms or functional overlay (27%), anxiety
(22%), cognitive decline or confusion (17%), agitation/aggression (13%),
suicidal ideation or behaviour (12%), and psychotic symptoms (12%).
Often, more than one reason for referral was provided; hence, the
percentages do not total 100%. As a reason for referral, ‘agitation’ was
associated most with organic disorders, ‘suicidal’ with adjustment
disorder and organic mood disorder, and ‘depression’ with mood
disorders, adjustment disorder and ‘no diagnosis’. Functional
symptoms/overlay were invariably associated with a psychiatric diagnosis
of dissociative/conversion disorders. Almost all (91%) of the referred
patients met the criteria for a psychiatric disorder according to
ICD-10. The most common primary psychiatric diagnoses were: mood
disorder (22%); dissociative disorder (18%); adjustment disorder (9%);
delirium (5%); organic disorders (24%), including organic mood disorder
(8.5%); and organic personality disorder (5%). In 9% of those referred,
no mental disorder was established (`Fig. 1 <#fig01>`__). Fig.
1Distribution of patients per diagnostic categories.

Seventy-eight of the referrals were sent from the regional in-patient
neurological unit, comprising 11% of the total of 679 admissions to that
unit. The age of referred patients was distributed evenly across the
decades of life, with a small peak in the 20–29 age group. The
female:male ratio was 1.4:1. Initial assessment only was completed for
31%, while 27% were seen twice, 14% three times, and the remainder four
times or more. Urgent referrals constituted 10% of all referrals from
this ward, and 83% of referral forms had documented a discussion with
the patient. Collectively, depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders
represented the most frequent diagnoses (32%), followed by ‘organic’
disorders (31%) and then somatoform disorders (21%). Most of those
referred (81%) had a past history of psychiatric disorder. The majority
of those patients diagnosed with dissociative disorders (70%) attended
out-patient follow-up with our service following discharge.

Discussion
==========

This is a retrospective study of referrals from a regional neurology
unit, which can come with its own limitations. Such a unit would
generally have more complex neurological in-patients with a higher rate
of neuropsychiatric comorbidity. However, the results of the present
study and previously published papers are broadly comparable, suggesting
no specific biases associated with our study population. The total
number of referrals was small, despite the expected prevalence of
psychiatric illnesses in neurological settings. This is in keeping with
the low rates of identification of psychiatric comorbidity found in
earlier prevalence studies. It may also suggest that neurology
colleagues have a high threshold for referral to the psychiatric
services. However, this implies that patients suspected to have
psychiatric disorder were not referred to specialist services.

| Our results show that patients referred to the team presented with a
  wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders (`Fig. 1 <#fig01>`__). The
  rates of mental disorder in our sample did not match those in
  community(n.d.o) or general hospital(n.d.p) settings, demonstrating
  the distinctive nature of neuropsychiatric samples. The most common
  categories in our population were mood disorders, organic disorders
  and dissociative disorders, while the most common reasons for
  referrals were ‘depression’ and ‘functional neurological symptoms’.
  Rates of disorder in our sample were close to those reported in
  previous studies,(n.d.m)\ :sup:`,`\ (n.d.n) with a few
  differences.(n.d.p) One difference is that depressive disorder
  accounted for 40% of referrals reported by Guthrie *et al* to their
  general liaison service that serves a large teaching hospital, but
  only 20% of our referrals received this diagnosis. Nevertheless, as
  for Guthrie *et al*, ‘depression’ was the leading reason for referral
  to our service and the most common diagnosis in our sample.
  Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders constituted a small portion of our
  workload, while they comprised one-third for Guthrie *et al*. Other
  significant differences were found in the rates of somatoform
  disorders (18.6 *v.* 2.6), organic disorders (24 *v.* 1.7), substance
  use disorders (4.8 *v.* 1.55) and personality disorders (0.7 *v.*
  3.8), as shown in `Table 1 <#tab01>`__. Not unexpectedly, perhaps, our
  neuropsychiatry team was referred a higher proportion of organic
  disorders compared with the general hospital liaison service of
  Guthrie *et al*. It might be that neurologists perceive
  neuropsychiatrists as more willing and/or able to manage patients with
  organic psychiatric disorders than a liaison psychiatric service, such
  as that of Fitzgerald *et al*. Alternatively, because the Atkinson
  Morley Centre is a tertiary unit which admits complex neurological
  cases, there may be a higher percentage of organic psychiatric
  disorder in the population we serve. Another difference was the higher
  rate of dissociative disorders compared with liaison psychiatry teams,
  which again likely reflects that a tertiary neurology centre admits
  the most complex functional cases for thorough investigation and
  intervention – especially as there is a dearth of neuropsychiatry
  services outside the London area. The unexpectedly low rate of
  substances misuse and personality disorders identified in our sample
  could reflect a reluctance to discuss these issues or an oddity of our
  population. Either way, this finding merits further evaluation. These
  variations will differentially influence the clinical expertise and
  practice of neuropsychiatrists and their colleagues in liaison
  psychiatry. Table 1Comparison of psychiatric diagnoses as a proportion

Regarding the acute in-patient neurological unit, our results
demonstrated a referral rate of only 11.16%, although previous studies
on the same ward have demonstrated substantially higher prevalence
rates. Utilising a battery of screening questionnaires followed by
psychiatric interview Jeffries *et al*\ (n.d.e) identified a
DSM-IV-defined mental disorder in 51.3% of 265 consecutive admissions
during a period of 6 months. Of these, 18.7% fulfilled the criteria for
two diagnoses, and 5.1% were diagnosed with three or more. Earls *et
al*\ (n.d.q) investigated rates of detection of psychiatric symptoms by
neurologists on this same ward 3 months pre and post Jeffries *et al*'s
screening period. This showed that neurologists recognised and
documented symptoms of mental illnesses in 23.7% of all admissions, but
referred fewer than half of these (10.4%), echoing our more recent
findings (11.6%). Taken together, this demonstrates that 70–80% of
neurological patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder are not being
referred to specialist services. Given the known impact of
neuropsychiatric comorbidity on quality of life, duration of hospital
stay, mortality, and cost of care, this may have a deleterious effect on
those unable to access timely and effective psychiatric
intervention.(n.d.r) Of those who were referred, analysis of the
reason(s) for referral indicated strong correlation with the eventual
confirmed diagnosis. The small number of patients who did not receive
any diagnosis points to a low rate of false positives. Thus, it appears
that neurology referrers were specific but not sensitive to
identification of cases. `Table 2 <#tab02>`__ suggests that few patients
with anxiety, adjustment disorders, personality disorders, and substance
misuse disorders were referred, while referral was made for only a
minority of those with depression and cognitive disorders.
Appropriately, all those with psychotic disorders were referred, as were
half the patients with somatoform disorders. Regarding patients with
cognitive impairment, it may be that neurologists consider themselves
capable of managing this patient group, as agitation was given as the
main reason for the referral in all cases involving that problem. Table

It is unclear how this under-referral affects the well-being of patients
and the efficiency of neurological departments. Similarly, Jonge *et al*
found that neurologists throughout Europe refer only a small proportion
of the psychiatric patients on their wards. Possibly, their recognition
of mental disorder is poor, or these comorbidities are considered
irrelevant to their neurological care. Jonge suggested a referral
procedure consisting of a short questionnaire to facilitate detection of
caseness.(n.d.n) Likewise, Jeffries *et al* concluded that psychiatric
screening questionnaires have a high sensitivity and specificity,
thereby representing a cost-effective and acceptable method for
improving identification of psychiatric morbidity and
comorbidity.(n.d.e) The intervening years have not lessened the
arguments for this approach. There is now a pressing need for strategic
planning to develop neuropsychiatric provision, both nationally and
internationally.(n.d.s)\ :sup:`–`\ (n.d.t) Provision of prospective
screening on neurological units and the impact of neuropsychiatric input
would require prospective evaluation to evaluate their utility and
efficacy.
