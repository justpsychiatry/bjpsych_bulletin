John Eagles's first novel is a rollicking tale of a young psychiatrist
in the early 1980s, on the threshold of his career. Unfortunately, this
promising career is nearly terminated as a consequence of various antics
– alleged and otherwise – and the book culminates in a visit to the
General Medical Council after the protagonist, Dr Douglas Barker, is
accused of sexual misconduct with a patient.

This book was easy to read and something of a page-turner, but
ultimately the characters were rather difficult to like. Douglas, who is
clearly meant to be a nice chap, has a hint of arrogance that detracts
from any potential sympathy for his plight. His approach to women
centres on their appearance and he has no compunction in forming quick
and easy relationships. There are allusions to his lost girlfriend,
Spider, possibly in an attempt to account for his behaviour, but this is
never really developed in a credible way. Most of the women in the book
are minimally developed as characters, either presented as sexually
attractive, needy, unpleasant or a combination of these. Pauline, a
nurse who supports Douglas at his hearing, may be an exception. However,
at the end of the book, Douglas rather disappointingly refers to her as
sexy and it also becomes evident that she lied for him; suggesting that
she may not be an exception after all.

Douglas's best friend, Chris, is another male psychiatric trainee from
the west of Scotland, with a rather stereotypical accent and drinking
habit. Both his educational supervisors are men and both of them are
rather unlikely characters, particularly Dr Burlington, who speaks in a
strange psychopathological manner, involving bizarre words that often
start with consecutive letters of the alphabet. Dr Burlington is
actually unbelievably nasty, but there is no hint as to why this is,
which might have created some more tension. There are two female
trainees in the story: Douglas has a fling with one before casting her
off to Chris, the other achieves a liaison with the much older, married
psychotherapy consultant. It would have been good to have incorporated
an intriguing female character with a storyline beyond providing
interest to the male characters of the book.

There is potential historical interest to current trainees, who may like
to read about training practices and services nearly 40 years ago. Some
things don't change and the patients' presentations and many treatments
remain similar; but it is a very different job now.

However, my main difficulty with this book was the denouement (spoiler
alert). Douglas was technically innocent because he had slept with the
patient in question before she was a patient, and he had forgotten due
to his previously unmentioned facial agnosia. But any opportunity for
exploration of such an unusual ethical dilemma was then subsumed in a
drunken train journey, in my view a great loss.
