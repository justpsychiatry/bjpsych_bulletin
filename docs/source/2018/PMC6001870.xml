The mean 25OHD level was 66.3&#x000a0;nmol/L (s.d. 33.6) and the median was 62.0&#x000a0;nmol/L, which represented a less extreme but still significant positive skew (Shapiro-Wilk: 0.914, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.035). The numbers of patients with sufficient and optimal 25OHD had improved substantially (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig 2</xref>).

This paper describes routinely collected data on serum 25OHD levels obtained at baseline prior to clinical decisions to treat any vitamin D deficiency, along with follow-up serum levels after a year. The rationale for the implementation of this protocol was based on concerns that low levels of sun exposure, the secure environment and the prescription of psychotropic medication put in-patients in a &#x02018;high risk&#x02019; category, with potentially serious long-term health sequelae.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>The data suggest considerable vitamin deficiency among this patient group. Furthermore, there were no clear differences in 25OHD levels between patients already in hospital when baseline screening took place and newly admitted patients. This might be attributed to deficiencies in the community, but, in a tertiary service, new admissions frequently transfer from other in-patient services. Limitations in the data available mean that further scrutiny is outside the scope of this paper. There appeared to be a trend for marginally lower 25OHD levels in secure wards compared with rehabilitation services, but there was no statistically significant variation.</p><p>Although no significant differences were found between patients taking psychotropic medication and those who were not, these factors remain of clinical concern with respect to bone health. A recent small-scale prospective study found that antipsychotics may inhibit vitamin D-metabolising enzymes, thereby causing a reduction in both calcium and 25OHD levels.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> This association is of particular concern given the known link between antipsychotics and osteoporosis risk via raised prolactin levels.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>Patients with normal 25OHD levels at baseline who were already on supplements all opted to continue with treatment. Those with normal levels at baseline who were not already receiving treatment were advised by their general practitioner based on the clinical scenario. Neither the supplemented nor the non-supplemented group had significant changes in their 25OHD status at follow-up, but numbers here were small.</p><p>Patients with suboptimal 25OHD levels were all offered supplementation using a standard protocol. Those who opted for supplementation had significantly higher 25OHD levels at follow-up, whereas those who opted out experienced non-significant changes. As the data here reported are routinely collected, it is not possible to make any systematic inference as to what lay behind a patient's decision to accept or decline supplementation.</p><p>Although vitamin D deficiency was widespread among this group, it was not present among all patients. There is some evidence from genome-wide association studies that genetic factors also have a significant role in identifying those at increased risk, but this is beyond the scope of this evaluation.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>Our data are commensurate with a study of psychiatric in-patients in a Scottish high-secure hospital at a similar geographical latitude to Northgate Hospital. That study concluded that all patients in secure settings should be screened and offered supplementation based on &#x02018;significant and serious&#x02019; deficiency of 25OHD associated with bone demineralisation.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Furthermore, such deficiencies do not appear to be limited to secure care. One study of people with IDD in institutionalised nursing care in Finland demonstrated significant 25OHD insufficiency, which was addressed by oral or intramuscular supplementation.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p><p>The data in this study were routinely collected and not prospectively planned, leading to limitations in their interpretation. Serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels were not routinely collected, nor were any bone mineralisation tests performed. No data on the content or vitamin D qualities of patients&#x02019; diets were collected. It is also not possible to comment on the longer-term health risks such as fractures without a larger, more specialised study. The patient group at Northgate is not ethnically diverse; all patients in this cohort were of white ethnicity. One study of a long-stay psychiatric in-patient facility found an association between low vitamin D levels and being of a BAME background, with improvements in 25OHD levels after treatment.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Another recent study in Tier 4 adolescent psychiatric services showed similar numbers of white and BAME patients with 25OHD deficiency (46 vs. 53%).<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>This raises the question as to whether all patients who are &#x02018;high risk&#x02019; should be offered treatment. The long stays of patients within secure services, along with concomitant medication, would put these patients within this category. Current guidance by Public Health England recommends a minimum of 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g per day for the general population aged four and above, where diet alone is insufficient.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, the choice between simple supplementation or a deficiency protocol for patients such as these has not been fully established. Furthermore, it has not been established whether supplementation should be offered without suitable baseline screening. It should also be considered that the more general effects of vitamin D supplementation are far from certain. A meta-analysis of 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggested that there was a modest reduction in overall mortality for people taking standard doses of 25OHD supplementation,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> but a more recent umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and RCTs found little convincing evidence of a clear role for vitamin D in health outcomes.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Nevertheless, this study has shown that in-patients with IDD appear to have deficiencies in vitamin D and that these are amenable to correction by oral supplementation in many cases. We recommend further research in this area, including prospective studies of the longer-term health sequelae.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to Dr Andreas Finkelmeyer, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, who assisted with the statistical analysis.</p></ack><notes id="nts2" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Iain McKinnon</bold>, Consultant Psychiatrist, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, and Honorary Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University, UK; <bold>Thomas Lewis</bold>, Specialist Registrar in Psychiatry, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, UK; <bold>Naomi Mehta</bold>, Consultant Psychiatrist, Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, UK; <bold>Shahed Imrit</bold>, Specialty Doctor, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, UK; <bold>Julie Thorp</bold>, Consultant Psychiatrist, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, UK; <bold>Chris Ince</bold>, Consultant Psychiatrist, Specialist Services, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Pearce</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cheetham</surname><given-names>TD.</given-names></name>
