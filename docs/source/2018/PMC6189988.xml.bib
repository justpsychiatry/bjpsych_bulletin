Julia Samuel, grief psychotherapist and Founder Patron of Child
Bereavement UK, presents a moving and thoughtful collection of
therapeutic encounters. Each brief narrative traces a careful line
between study and story, reminiscent of *The Examined Life* by Stephen
Grosz. The style of the case story captures the uniqueness of grief and
the therapeutic process, reminding us that these are not illustrations
of pathology.

Samuel's studies, written in spacious and measured prose, are fearless
in their approach. She includes those bereaved by miscarriage, trauma
and suicide, and explores the many ways people try to cope. She gently
reveals the complex emotional experiences and interpersonal difficulties
that emerge, yet her own human response is never far from the text.

The case stories are divided according to the relationship to the
deceased, and each section is followed by Samuel's own reflections and
references to existing research. The author is keen to present positive
accounts of healing and recovery, together with practical advice for the
bereaved. This may explain why abnormal grief does not feature among the
selected cases.

Samuel's person-centred psychotherapeutic approach is apparent
throughout. This alliance carries through to her reflections and may
explain why she often does not grapple with conceptual questions or
distinctions. Indeed, Samuel avoids an explicit espousal of any
particular model of grief. While classical theorists such as Bowlby and
Kübler-Ross are summarily acknowledged, Samuel maintains her
person-centred focus, helping to construct narratives with her clients.
She reveals the tensions that arise and hints at the inner workings of
grief while resisting any theoretical speculation. At times, Samuel uses
a more integrated therapeutic approach, allowing for a broader
understanding of her clients' difficulties according to different
modalities. She identifies unhelpful defence mechanisms and cognitive
distortions: where grief is bound up in strong cultural identity, Samuel
makes reference to Jungian archetypes; to help a client struggling to
achieve emotional stability, she works with a transitional object.

The significance of grief may be immediately recognisable to the
psychotherapist, whether in the form of bereavement or as part of
uncomplicated psychosocial development; however, hidden among Samuel's
optimistic reflections are many reminders of why grief matters to the
psychiatrist. Historically, grief has represented a line in the sand,
demarcating normal experience from psychopathology. However, the removal
of the ‘bereavement exclusion criteria’ from DSM-5 appears to challenge
this, reintroducing grief as a viable precipitant in some disorders.
Additionally, failure to recognise features of normal or unresolved
grief can lead to misdiagnosis. Even in cases of uncomplicated grief,
hallucinatory phenomena remind us that the boundary between normal
experience and mental illness may not be a fixed one. Though choosing to
err on the side of hope and resolution, Samuel's tenderly written
accounts give voice to the weight of these experiences. Unresolved grief
nonetheless continues to raise many questions and, as noted in the
DSM-5, remains a recommendation for further study.
