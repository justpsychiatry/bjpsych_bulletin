We must somehow assimilate the bewildering array of information, as it hurtles towards us, through our screens and across our airwaves, to get to the truth of the matter.</p><p>In our clinical lives, this becomes a responsibility and the challenge here is considerable. The public perception of mental illness, its fixation with &#x02018;madness,&#x02019; is fertile ground for the development of half-truths, fallacies, myths and speculations. Publicly and privately propagated, we amass a compendium of &#x02018;alternative facts,&#x02019; harmful to our patients as well as to our professions.</p><p>Psychologists Arkowitz and Lilienfeld are having none of it. They have subjected our day-to-day assumptions to a rigorous interrogation, pitching them against the most current evidence, to separate fact from fiction. Their book is presented neatly into sections by diagnostic category, each comprising a collection of bite-size chapters, asking questions such as: <italic>What is a psychopath? How violent are people with mental illness? Can herbs ease anxiety and depression? Is divorce bad for children?</italic> The questions they select feel current, the sort frequently encountered in the public domain, making the book highly suitable for a general readership. It is also probably quite helpful for mental health professionals, who may read the pages with the occasional blush, when they find a long-held position ruthlessly upended.</p><p>At times the book feels a little political, particularly in its service to psychological therapies; there is a sense that the authors feel a duty to redress the pharmaceutical dominance in mental health treatments. Though perhaps a worthy pursuit, this sits a little uneasily as a potential source of bias in a book that sets itself up on a truth-seeking mission.</p><p>Nevertheless, the book is a steadying force in a world where we now take a rather relaxed attitude to accuracy. Where the truth is often obscured by a more marketable headline, it is important as professionals that we anchor ourselves as far as we can in the facts. Arkowitz and Lilienfeld are to be thanked for doing a lot of the hard work for us.</p></body></article>
