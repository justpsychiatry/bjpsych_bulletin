The first draft of the questionnaire was piloted to test for suitability and for ease of data collection. Suggested changes were made to improve the quality of data collection, using Microsoft Excel. A lead clinician or manager (link person) with a remit for liaison psychiatry service was identified within each health board in Wales.

At this stage service provision cannot be explained by level of need or referral numbers in each health board as this information is only collected on a local level. To present the mapping more clearly and allow easier comparison, the data is set out by health board rather than by individual liaison teams or hospitals covered by the teams. In the two health boards where age-specific liaison teams operate, we have included the breakdown of these teams.</p><p>We identified that in the past 2 years there has been a considerable overall increase in the level of staffing within liaison psychiatry services in Wales. No health board has a liaison service comprising only nursing staff, whereas in 2007, this was the case in three out of eight liaison psychiatry services. Dementia support workers have been included in two old-age liaison psychiatry services. Five health boards include the provision of occupational therapy services. One old-age service includes support from a pharmacist. C&#x00026;V UHB previously established a nurse-led substance misuse liaison service consisting of three nurses. The health board also has a dedicated service for people presenting to the A&#x00026;E department with alcohol-related issues, which was developed with separate public health funding. Betsi Cadwalder University Health Board provides two nurses dedicated to an alcohol misuse service within its liaison psychiatry service.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first survey of liaison psychiatry services in Wales since additional funding was provided by the Welsh Government in 2015. At a national level, medical staffing has trebled and nurse staffing has doubled since 2007. This mapping process identified the progress in establishing multi-disciplinary services with an increase in the number of nurses, dedicated psychology support, the inclusion of occupational therapists and dementia support workers with additional consultant posts. This mapping exercise was undertaken using the available resources, with no additional funding for this work. We achieved this through multi-agency collaborative work between the Public Health Wales 1000 Lives Improvement service, NHS Wales Delivery Unit and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Wales.</p><p>Historically some health boards had no specific liaison psychiatry teams and relied on community mental health teams and duty psychiatrist cover. In some areas a collaborative &#x02018;goodwill&#x02019; arrangement existed between consultant colleagues to provide cover for the mental health needs of patients in acute hospitals where no specific cover for liaison psychiatry teams was in place. For these health boards, the new funding from the Welsh Government for liaison psychiatry has been of particular significance. In certain instances, the duty system and crisis teams continue to provide cover to A&#x00026;E departments out of hours. In addition to government-funded developments, locally funded initiatives have also enhanced these services. This survey did not collect detailed information on these local arrangements or the division of government funding for setting up these services, which is a potential limitation.</p><p>The health boards in Wales had autonomously established services according to local needs and requirements. Wales is diverse in its geography and demography, with a mix of rural and urban centres, and the size of geographical areas covered by the individual health board varies. These factors could have influenced the manner in which liaison psychiatry teams have been established by health boards.</p><p>The previous survey undertaken in 2008 reported that, in total, there were only two relatively well-established services in Wales: Cardiff and Swansea.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In North Wales, a service delivered by a less than full-time consultant with some nursing support existed. Before funding from the Welsh Government becoming available, Cardiff and Swansea had set up old-age liaison psychiatry services. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board piloted the old-age Rapid Assessment, Interface and Discharge<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> model in the Royal Gwent Hospital and this is now also the model used by the old-age liaison service in C&#x00026;V UHB.</p><p>A liaison psychiatry team should include a consultant psychiatrist, mental health nurses and a psychologist as a core part of this team. Recommended minimum staffing numbers vary with the size of the hospital and type of service.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Published models of liaison psychiatry are named Core, Core 24, Enhanced 24 and Comprehensive. For example, the minimum numbers for a Core liaison psychiatry service covering around 500 beds are two whole-time equivalent consultant psychiatrists and eight whole-time equivalent nurses, in addition to other staff.</p><p>The PLAN<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> has provided quality standards for liaison psychiatry services. Since LPSE-1 was undertaken, there have been two further surveys of liaison psychiatry in England, with response rates of 100% and 97%, respectively. The LPSE has charted the growth of liaison psychiatry in England against the government commitment to establish liaison psychiatry in every acute hospital with an A&#x00026;E department in England by 2021, with half of these meeting the Core 24 specifications. A fourth survey, LPSE-4, is planned for 2018.</p><p>The challenge within Wales will be to evaluate the effect of the newly established liaison psychiatry services. Information currently available suggests that different health boards have invested in developing services in line with their local vision and perceived requirements. Within the relatively small sample of Welsh health boards, there is diversity in the type of liaison psychiatry services provided.</p><p>We recommend that information for the next logical phase should be obtained on referral rates to these services. Furthermore, it would be prudent to set standards for liaison psychiatry services in Wales. These standards could be similar to the standards that have evolved in England or bespoke liaison psychiatry standards could be developed for Wales. Hence, further work might also involve assessment of adherence to the agreed standards.</p><p>There is an opportunity to learn from the experiences in England. An important lesson from the experience of the LPSE process in England is the need to repeat the mapping exercise over a period of time to assess progress. Moreover, comparison with services in England may emphasise the need for future funding to develop liaison psychiatry services in Wales.</p><p>There is an opportunity to gather further data on referrals, standards, patient experience, outcome measures and the evolution of services. There is also an opportunity for health boards to learn from services with a well-established substance misuse liaison service and intellectual disability liaison service.</p><p>Liaison psychiatry for children and adolescents in Wales, as in England, is less well developed. Furthermore, investment in a liaison psychiatry service for the specialist Velindre Cancer Centre will need to be considered, as will the arrangements in Powys Teaching Health Board, which does not have any acute general hospitals.</p><p>It is anticipated that the development in Welsh liaison psychiatry services will attract trainees to liaison psychiatry for foundation, core and higher training. Previously there were only two services in Wales that provided higher training leading to endorsement in liaison psychiatry.</p><p>In conclusion, liaison psychiatry services in Wales are developing and evolving. It would be prudent to monitor this evolution with a view to setting standards, surveying adherence to the standards and monitoring the referrals for an outcome-oriented evaluation of these services. Already, in collaboration with Public Health Wales and the NHS Delivery Unit, plans are in place for developing the governance to address the recommendations discussed in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to all the liaison psychiatry teams in the health boards who contributed to information for this paper.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Tayyeb A.
