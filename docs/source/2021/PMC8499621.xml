A study on associations between air pollution and neighbourhood characteristics in England and The Netherlands found higher concentrations in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England, with higher concentrations in both countries in neighbourhoods with &#x0003e;20% non-White populations, after adjustment for urbanisation and other variables.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>On a global scale, there is increasing recognition that climate change is compounding many health inequities and undermining pre-existing support structures which protect against poor mental health.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The climate crisis has been called a racist crisis, reflecting both its disproportionate effects on Black communities and people of colour globally, as well as its evident unequal effects within countries.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Following Hurricane Katrina, for example, Black New Orleanians faced greater stress than their White counterparts, even after adjustment for demographics, parental status, evacuation timing, home damage and job status; income had no clear effect.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> There was a similar pattern for post-traumatic stress disorder, which was partly but not fully explained by greater baseline mental distress.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>In recent years, campaigns for international action on climate change have highlighted how unjust social and economic systems, including legacies of colonialism, structural racism, and other exclusionary forces such as sexism and ableism at all levels shape vulnerability to the effects of climate change on mental and physical health. We contend, as argued by Leon Sealey-Huggins and colleagues (2018), that &#x02018;we can only properly understand the harm being wrought by weather events and climate change by directly connecting it to broader social and political processes, of which structural racism is a central part&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Future research must further clarify the mechanisms as a result of which people with severe mental illness are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. This should include a recognition of closely interwoven vulnerabilities due to social exclusion, stigma and direct consequences of their illness or medications, as well as the effects of unequal distribution of resources at local, national and international levels, all of which affect people's and communities&#x02019; capacities to cope and adapt.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>Intersections between urban health inequalities and climate change effects</title><p>Cities are the places where most people live globally &#x02013; 56% of the global population as of 2018<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> &#x02013; and are the places where people are most exposed to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, the urban heat island effect means that higher temperatures are experienced in urban areas than in more rural ones nearby, and access to places for people to cool off in, such as shady green spaces or waterways, is often more limited. The health effects of rising exposure to high temperatures are not only physical but have also been associated with increased risks of mental ill health<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and with suicide.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Cities are also a key focus for research into mental health inequalities, particularly in relation to differences in urban versus rural rates of schizophrenia. The spatial distributions of other mental health outcomes such as suicide and self-injury are less clear cut, suggesting a greater need to further understand the influence of sociocultural and environmental characteristics of particular neighbourhoods.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> One example of this is how qualitative methods have begun to unpack the paradoxically low rates of direct self-harm in highly deprived areas in London.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>People in cities often experience the greatest exposure to some of the key contributors to climate change, including air pollution from fossil fuels and degradation of green space. Further, increased exposure to poor-quality air and green spaces often mirrors and compounds pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities. Evidence on the lifelong effects of air pollution on mental health outcomes such as depression continues to emerge.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Exposure to air pollution and traffic noise are similarly unequal for different neighbourhoods with regard to both socioeconomic status and ethnicity, with those least likely to own a car often most likely to live in traffic-clogged and polluted areas.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> At the same time, good access to urban nature can help to partially mitigate the harmful effects of socioeconomic inequalities.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Further, there has been greater awareness of the urgent need for more urban green space<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and a recognition of strong disparities in access to green space in European cities.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Access to green space has been linked with reduced depression risk,<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and there is increasing recognition that social factors affecting both availability<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and levels of use<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> seem to mediate the mental health effects of green and blue spaces such as parks, forests, rivers and beaches.</p><p>There is increasing evidence of biologically plausible explanations of associations between urban environmental exposures and mental health. These include the effects of traffic and air population exposure on neurodevelopmental pathways in children,<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> neuroinflammation across the life course,<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and changes in arousal and stress responses associated with time spent in green space.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Proposed mechanisms through which the green space's benefits may be manifest include a shift in attention, promoting curiosity, social networks, group cooperation and physical activity. However, methodological and interpretation challenges remain, for example, in understanding the importance of confounding factors such as noise pollution and general neighbourhood deprivation.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Limited studies have translated these observations into robust evidence for improved mental health.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>There is also a lack of research from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) on the effects of climate change on mental health. This is urgently needed to inform policy action in these contexts. In LMIC contexts, forced migration due to climate change &#x02013; with the destination locations often being cities &#x02013; is a significant challenge, and studies have highlighted that dislocation from one's home compromises emotional well-being related to happiness, life satisfaction, optimism for the future and spiritual contentment, even despite well-intentioned relocation programmes focused on material compensation and livelihood re-establishment.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3"><title>Challenges in conceptualising complexity</title><p>For mental health, &#x02018;the risks and impacts of climate change&#x000a0;&#x02026;&#x000a0;are already rapidly accelerating, resulting in a number of direct, indirect, and overarching effects that disproportionally affect those who are most marginalised&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Our ability to fully appreciate and act on these vulnerabilities has been constrained by complexity on multiple levels, from the geographic scale to the interrelated nature of the underlying causal mechanisms.</p><p>These constraints have limited research into the effects of climate change on mental health, to date. Quantitative approaches have tended to focus mostly on proximate causes, which can obscure important structural and political drivers of the distribution of mental health effects of climate-related heatwaves, floods, wildfires and droughts.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Studies which have found associations between heat and mental health outcomes such as suicide have also cautioned about the difficulties of ascertaining causal effects using an ecological study design.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Berry et al (2018) proposed that a systems approach that accounts for interrelated and interdependent factors, forming a complex whole, is important for future research thinking and leadership around climate change and mental health.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We argue that this approach should also accommodate a structural and intersectional understanding of pre-existing inequalities in mental health. This may come from approaches which address broader inter-penetrative global socioeconomic processes such as globalisation,<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and the syndemics model of health that focuses on &#x02018;interacting, co-present or sequential diseases and the social and environmental factors that promote and enhance the negative effects of disease interaction&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4"><title>The role of psychiatry in understanding and addressing climate change</title><p>In 2015, our Australasian colleagues<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> proposed the &#x02018;CARM&#x02019; approach &#x02013; to collaborate, advocate, research (and educate) and mitigate &#x02013; as a framework for psychiatrists to join with a growing number of medical entities to act on climate change.

As advocates for patients&#x02019; and communities&#x02019; mental health and well-being, psychiatrists can help to drive these objectives forwards. There is already strong evidence that the psychiatric community can use in advocating for policies and interventions which can build local community resilience and tackle global injustice. These could include but are not limited to urban planning and regeneration; increased green space; cleaner air; community food growing; liveable streets; and high-quality, low-carbon housing. Importantly, they should also include national and international policies for urgent action on climate change and protection for those harmed or displaced by it, which may further exacerbate pre-existing mental health inequalities. With an already increasing frequency of adverse weather events, there is also an important role for the psychiatric community in advocating for policies and funding support for appropriate mental health interventions in the wake of climate-driven events such as floods, major storms and wildfires, and to strengthen resilience to them.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3" sec-type="other"><title>Research (and educate)</title><p>A better understanding of the causes of inequalities, vulnerability and climate resilience as they relate to mental health is clearly needed, requiring changes to both research and education. Alongside more established quantitative epidemiological approaches, this is likely to benefit from qualitative and narrative methods, as well as systems approaches that recognise the complexity of these interlinked causal relationships and policy challenges.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We should continue to build the evidence base for action, including through participatory and action research methods that emphasise the voices, needs and priorities of those who are most climate vulnerable and which seek to tackle structural injustices.

Against a backdrop of both national health service and governmental carbon reduction initiatives, psychiatric services must also both reduce their own emissions and improve mental healthcare, to avoid contributing further to the root causes of climate-related mental distress.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The time is now for concerted action to better understand and intervene in the structures and policies that create and perpetuate social and ethnic inequalities globally and harm planetary health. Working together to create the conditions for good mental health, such as enabling equitable access to resources, services and healthy environments, will also strengthen climate resilience and health equality across society. We can no longer overlook the interconnected ecological and social crises, and psychiatrists can play a critical part in defining the fairer and healthier society of tomorrow.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec6"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Shuo Zhang</bold> is a Core Psychiatry Trainee at South London and the Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK; <bold>Isobel Braithwaite</bold> is an Academic Clinical Fellow in Public Health and ST4 Public Health Registrar at UCL Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London.
