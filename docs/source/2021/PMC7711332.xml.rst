:Abstract:
   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the UK's National Health
   Service (NHS) has been transformed to meet the acute healthcare needs
   of infected patients. This has significantly affected medical
   education, both undergraduate and postgraduate, with potential
   long-term implications for psychiatric recruitment. This article
   discusses these ramifications, and the opportunities available to
   mitigate them as well as to enhance the profile of psychiatry.

When it became clear that the first two cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection
reported in the UK in January 2020\ :sup:`1` represented an emerging
pandemic, the National Health Service (NHS) completely reconfigured its
services. To meet the needs of patients diagnosed with COVID-19,
elective treatments were cancelled, face-to-face appointments moved
online and huge numbers of healthcare workers were redeployed. While
mass transfers of staff to front-line roles were facilitated, movements
of other healthcare workers were delayed or cancelled: 20 000 junior
doctors due to rotate training placements on 1 April 2020 were informed
by Health Education England that, except in exceptional circumstances,
their rotations were cancelled.\ :sup:`2` At the same time, medical
students throughout the country faced widespread disruption of their
studies.\ :sup:`3` Both these events have resulted in a significant
number of undergraduate and postgraduate medical trainees missing out on
psychiatry placements, with potentially significant consequences for
future recruitment into the specialty. These have not gone
unnoticed.\ :sup:`4`

The recruitment crisis in psychiatry and its wider workforce implications
=========================================================================

Concerns about recruitment into psychiatry are not new. A review of
medical student career choices over 40 years demonstrated that the
number choosing to specialise in psychiatry has remained constant – at
4–5% – despite the increasing mental health needs of the
population.\ :sup:`5` Surveys of career choices of foundation doctors
show a similarly fixed number applying for core psychiatry
training.\ :sup:`6` A recent estimate suggests that, if the projected
increase in Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) holders is
accurate (based on numbers applying to training), by 2033 there will be
a per capita reduction in psychiatrists of around 11%.\ :sup:`7`

A number of reasons for this crisis have been suggested. These include
stigma towards the profession, perceived lack of a scientific basis to
diagnosis and treatment, and erosion of the role of the psychiatrist
within mental health teams.\ :sup:`8` Poor teaching and clinical
experience at medical school have also been implicated.\ :sup:`9` In
contrast, experience of psychiatry during foundation training has been
found to have a positive influence in choosing the
specialty.\ :sup:`10,11` During medical school, the length, quality of
teaching and types of patient interaction have been identified as
important.\ :sup:`12`

Knowledge of the push and pull factors for the specialty has led to the
development of a number of initiatives to promote recruitment.
University-based enrichment activities\ :sup:`13,14` such as Psych
Socs,\ :sup:`15` special study modules (SSMs) and summer schools have
emerged to support and encourage medical students with an interest in
the field. Nationally, the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) has
developed the Psych Star Scheme and student Associate role, to enable
enthusiastic medical students to further their interest in the
field.\ :sup:`16` Following graduation, ‘flexible pay premia’ encourage
applications for hard-to-fill posts,\ :sup:`17` including psychiatry. In
parallel, the RCPsych's Choose Psychiatry campaign promotes psychiatry
to medical students and foundation doctors through the use of videos,
social media and podcasts.\ :sup:`18`

All of these complement the recent expansion in the number of psychiatry
posts within the UK Foundation Programme. This was a direct response to
concerns regarding recruitment into psychiatry and was recommended in
the 2014 Broadening Foundation Programme report.\ :sup:`19` It is
recognised that the structure of the NHS and provision of healthcare
need to change to meet the challenges of treating a population that is
older, with increasing numbers of chronic health conditions. It
emphasised the need for the Foundation Programme to provide broad-based
training for junior doctors, giving them adequate experience and
education in community and mental healthcare.\ :sup:`19` Key for
psychiatry was the recommendation that 22.5% of Foundation Year 1 (FY1)
doctors and 22.5% Foundation Year 2 doctors (FY2) should have a post in
psychiatry.\ :sup:`19` Alongside the hope that this would boost
recruitment into the specialty, it also represented an acknowledgement
that there are numerous skills, including communication, empathetic
understanding and multidisciplinary learning, acquired within a
psychiatric placement, that are valuable whatever specialty the post
holder ends up practising in.\ :sup:`20`

Despite this increase, many foundation doctors still have limited
clinical experience of psychiatry. To address this the RCPsych,
alongside the UK Foundation Programme, has developed Psychiatry
Foundation Fellowships.\ :sup:`21` These offer access to additional
education and supervision resources to support doctors with an interest
in the field during their foundation years through to specialty
application. Academic Foundation Posts in psychiatry offer opportunities
for trainees interested in research, directly challenging the negative
assumptions regarding the lack of scientific basis to the
field.\ :sup:`8` Additionally, pilot Longitudinal Integrated Foundation
Training (LIFT) posts in psychiatry are being developed, following the
success of these in general practice.\ :sup:`22`

A recent announcement by the RCPsych suggests that these initiatives are
working. In England, fill rates for core psychiatry training have
increased for the third year running, with almost 100% of places filled
for August 2020.\ :sup:`23`

.. _sec2:

The impact of COVID-19 on medical education
===========================================

On 12 March 2020, all doctors in the UK were informed that they would
need to respond ‘rapidly and professionally’ to the challenge of
COVID-19 and might be required to work in areas outside their usual
practice.\ :sup:`24` Although it was initially suggested that foundation
doctors currently in mental health placements would not be
redeployed,\ :sup:`2` different local arrangements meant that some were
moved from psychiatry to front-line roles.\ :sup:`25` This was followed
by the cancellation of all medical training rotations in April, May,
June and July.\ :sup:`2,26`

There are approximately 15 000 foundation doctors in the UK,\ :sup:`27`
and thanks to the changes to the Foundation Programme, a significant
number now undertake a post in psychiatry across their 2-year foundation
training. One-third of these were due to start on 1 April 2020 but did
not. If undertaking a high-quality psychiatry post during foundation
training increases the likelihood that a trainee will apply to the
specialty,\ :sup:`20` this is likely to have a negative impact on the
recruitment cycles for 2021 and 2022.

Undergraduate medical education has also faced significant upheaval. In
the early weeks of March 2020, universities across the UK suspended
face-to-face teaching and other educational activities. For medical
students this meant the widespread cancellation of their clinical and
elective placements,\ :sup:`3` and a move to online education. While
final year medical students were being fast-tracked through
pre-registration to support the front line,\ :sup:`28` students in other
years missed out on vital educational experiences.\ :sup:`29` The impact
of these changes is already emerging.\ :sup:`30` A recent survey of
final year medical students found that over a third had their final year
objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) cancelled and almost
half had assistantships cancelled, with significant effects on
self-reported ratings of preparedness to start as FY1
doctors.\ :sup:`30`

For psychiatry recruitment, the effects could be profound. Psychiatry
placements often take place in the penultimate year of medical school.
These students will now move into their final year, where the focus is
on preparing for practice, with little time in the curriculum to make up
for missed clinical placements. Given the uncertainty regarding the
status of clinical placements during a second wave of the pandemic, it
is highly likely that further year groups will similarly miss out on
vital face-to-face psychiatry experience. In addition, the impact of the
cancellation of the SSMs, elective placements and other enrichment
activities, known to be key to fostering positive attitudes to a career
in the specialty,\ :sup:`13–15` is perhaps more concerning. These
activities are available throughout medical school. The legacy of these
losses therefore, means that the after-effects of the pandemic on
psychiatric recruitment could be felt for years.

.. _sec3:

The impact of COVID-19 on mental health
=======================================

The potential impact on recruitment is particularly concerning given the
postulated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population's mental
health.\ :sup:`31` There is already evidence of psychological sequelae
in those who were infected with SARS-Cov-2.\ :sup:`32` More broadly, the
impact of the public health measures, including shielding, social
distancing and quarantine, is starting to emerge; a recent national
survey demonstrated an increase in mental health problems across all age
groups in April 2020.\ :sup:`33` In the longer term, the consequences of
the predicted economic recession\ :sup:`34` will further increase
psychiatric morbidity. These effects will be against a back-drop of a
pre-pandemic predicted increase in mental healthcare needs within the
population\ :sup:`35` and ongoing workforce supply
difficulties.\ :sup:`36`

.. _sec4:

Opportunities to mitigate the potential impact of COVID-19 on recruitment into psychiatry
=========================================================================================

What can be done and what are the opportunities? Over the coming months,
there will hopefully be some time to consider what we can do to mitigate
any negative impact the acute response to COVID-19 has on recruitment
into psychiatry. There are a number of dimensions to this.

Foundation trainee rotations have now resumed. In addition to the
recommendations for these placements made by the RCPsych,\ :sup:`37`
trainers should take the opportunity to highlight some of the positive
effects the NHS response to the pandemic has had on the delivery of
mental healthcare, for example the cross-specialty collaborations
demonstrated by initiatives such as the CoroNerve,\ :sup:`38` the
potential for telehealth, or new research avenues such as the role of
the immune system in emerging psychiatric symptoms.\ :sup:`32` These
clearly demonstrate how central psychiatry is to the health and
scientific communities' response to COVID-19, helping challenge many of
the negative views of the specialty.

For those doctors who missed out on their chance to undertake a
psychiatry foundation post, there are other opportunities for their
potential enthusiasm to be encouraged. Existing initiatives for
foundation doctors should be strengthened,\ :sup:`39` with targeted
invites to those doctors affected by the cancellation of rotations, if
possible. For FY1 doctors there remains the opportunity to undertake
taster days in psychiatry as FY2s. These are usually limited, but given
the flexibility foundation doctors demonstrated to facilitate the NHS's
acute COVID-19 response, supporting them to make up for lost clinical
experience by extending these seems reasonable.

Foundation doctors are increasingly not applying directly to specialty
training, instead undertaking F3 and F4 years.\ :sup:`6` The expansion
of clinical fellowships in psychiatry – which offer full access to
supervision and the other educational opportunities that core trainees
receive – may offer alternative opportunities for those who missed out
first time round.\ :sup:`40`

The Medical Schools Council has outlined the need for clinical
placements to restart,\ :sup:`41` with priority given to those closer to
graduation. Further cohorts of medical students are therefore likely to
be affected by the loss of clinical experience in psychiatry. In recent
years, virtual work experience programmes have been developed to support
school-age students considering a career in medicine.\ :sup:`42`
Universities should consider learning lessons from these, to create
virtual psychiatry placements, with an emphasis on patient interaction
and high-quality clinical teaching. This could complement the number of
psychiatric summer and autumn schools that have already moved
online.\ :sup:`43`

Although developing imaginative alternatives to face-to-face clinical
placements is important, it is essential that this does not become the
default. Positive attributes of undergraduate psychiatry education
include time on placement, working directly with the multidisciplinary
team and the influence of role models from within the psychiatric
team.\ :sup:`44` It is hard to see how these can be achieved remotely.
The continued facilitation of face-to-face psychiatry experience for
medical students should therefore remain a priority.

It has been suggested that time for enrichment activities such as SSMs
should be redirected towards core clinical placement
activity.\ :sup:`41` It is vital that undergraduate psychiatry
departments are involved in these discussions. Not only are enrichment
activities in psychiatry important for recruitment, they help fight
stigma towards the specialty and the patient population. These should be
viewed not as optional extras, but as essential to creating a generation
of doctors who view mental illness in parity with physical illness.

One of the positive outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the speed
and readiness with which medical education departments have adapted to
the use of online learning. The Medical Schools Council is recommending
the use of a number of online platforms to support undergraduate
education.\ :sup:`45` It is vital that psychiatric education is embedded
throughout these. The potential for moving SSMs and other psychiatric
enrichment activities online should also be fully explored. The use of
webinars has greatly expanded as a result of the pandemic, with the
RCPsych producing a number that are freely available, and grand rounds
and journal clubs now frequently take this form. Delivering psychiatric
education this way offers great scope to widen the potential audience,
with the main barrier being the lack of awareness among potential
attendees. At a national level these resources should be highlighted
within the Choose Psychiatry campaign. More locally, promotion of online
educational material should be embedded within induction for medical
students and via local postgraduate education departments.

The expansion of simulation for psychiatry is another area of
potential.\ :sup:`46` These courses should be re-offered to those who
missed out on their clinical placements, as well as expanded to
supplement loss of clinical experience of future students. Although much
postgraduate education remains online, face-to-face foundation
simulation programmes continue. A number of providers have already
developed psychiatric simulation courses for foundation doctors, but
frequently these are available only to trainees undertaking a psychiatry
post. The skills of managing risk, communication, human factors and
de-escalation, inherent in these courses, are key outcomes of the
Foundation Programme Curriculum\ :sup:`47` and could easily be
incorporated into existing programmes. Through their inclusion alongside
other ‘core’ subjects, psychiatric simulation courses would reduce
stigma as well as encourage some to consider a future career in the
specialty.

Conclusions
===========

Developing a set of strengthened undergraduate and postgraduate
psychiatric educational resources can only benefit future recruitment
into the specialty. But as autumn continues, we are now are facing the
second wave of COVID-19 cases. Although the redeployments of healthcare
workers and cancellations of placements were necessary first time round,
it is essential that we reflect on their impact. Understanding the
effects of the acute management of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric
recruitment is vital to inform decisions regarding future suspensions of
medical student attachments and movements of trainee doctors. These must
try to balance the acute requirements of COVID-19 patients with the need
to ensure that there is an adequate psychiatric workforce to address not
only the current, but also future mental health repercussions of the
pandemic.
