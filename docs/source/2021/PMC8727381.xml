Medical students reported multiple benefits of mentoring, including enhanced personal and professional development, increased career and clinical knowledge, and broadened exposure to psychiatry.

Further evaluation is required to determine the long-term effects of mentoring and how this may compare with other undergraduate enrichment activities.

As well as increasing the number of doctors entering medical school, policy has recently focused on improving the exposure and experience of psychiatry training at undergraduate level.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Prior research has demonstrated that regular early undergraduate exposure to psychiatry (through the Psychiatry Early Experience Programme, PEEP) can sustain positive attitudes towards psychiatry and challenge preconceptions about the specialty.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, little is known about the value of mentorship for medical students interested in psychiatry, despite this demonstrating clear value for students and doctors in other specialties and the broader literature.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>This paper describes and evaluates the establishment of an undergraduate enrichment programme that combines opportunities for mentorship with additional clinical exposure to psychiatry. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the potential role of undergraduate mentorship in improving recruitment to the profession. We also evaluate the potential utility of mentoring for supporting, and promoting the development of, the future psychiatric workforce.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Method</title><p>PsychStart, a career-based mentoring scheme for medical students interested in psychiatry, was co-founded by two of the authors (T.H. and N.T.) at the University of Nottingham in January 2018.</p><p>Medical students from all year groups were recruited to the scheme via communication through the student-led psychiatry society Mind Matters, social media advertising (Facebook and Twitter) and signposting during lectures and psychiatry teaching.</p><p>There are approximately 280 students in undergraduate years 1 and 2 of the Nottingham medical course, and 100 students in graduate-entry years 1 and 2. The undergraduate and graduate students merge during year 3, with approximately 380 students in years 3&#x02013;5 of the medical programme. The psychiatry module is taught in year 4, and approximately 45 students complete this module at any one time.</p><p>Mentors were recruited from three local healthcare trusts that provide clinical psychiatry placements, as well as from the University of Nottingham and the university's Institute of Mental Health, facilitating the involvement of both academic and clinical psychiatrists. Mentor recruitment was limited to registrars (specialty trainee year 4 and above, ST4+) and consultant psychiatrists across a wide range of psychiatric subspecialties.</p><p>Places on the scheme were allocated on a first-come-first-served basis when appropriate mentors became available. Medical students were matched 1:1 or 2:1 to registrar or consultant psychiatrist mentors according to three main criteria: subspecialty interests, geographical location of mentors&#x02019; workplaces and students&#x02019; placements locations, and other career interests (e.g. in research, management or education).</p><p>All mentors and mentees were invited to attend a 2&#x000a0;h training session, with scheduled time incorporated for the initial &#x02018;meet and greet&#x02019; between mentors and mentees. The mentor training was led by a consultant psychiatrist with experience of medical education and the Nottingham psychiatry module (N.T.), with input from the Director of Student Wellbeing. Mentor training topics covered the role of a mentor, theories of mentoring, characteristics of positive and negative mentorship, the structure and scope of the PsychStart scheme, the context of psychiatry at Nottingham medical school, and student welfare and support. Mentee training was coordinated by a junior doctor (T.H.) and/or the President of the student-led PsychStart committee, with oversight from a consultant psychiatrist (N.T.). Mentee training topics included the role of a mentee, characteristics of positive and negative mentoring interactions, the structure and scope of the PsychStart scheme, and career pathways and opportunities in psychiatry.</p><p>No minimum or maximum restrictions were placed on the frequency of mentor&#x02013;mentee contact, but monthly email contact was recommended initially to promote engagement.</p><p>A generic email account was created for general communication and administrative queries. A separate email account monitored by a consultant psychiatrist (N.T.) was used for communication of any mentoring difficulties or issues requiring senior input.</p><p>Regular surveys were distributed to mentees to evaluate the different mentoring relationships and identify any requiring extra support. Any failing or inactive mentoring relationships, as identified by survey data and communication with the scheme's co-founders, were discussed with the concerned mentors and mentees. Where appropriate, some mentoring relationships were subject to reallocation.</p><p>To celebrate successes on the scheme and support the network, annual awards evenings were established where mentoring achievements were formally recognised. Awards were selected using information from regular feedback surveys, and mentors and mentees were also given the opportunity to submit nominations.</p><p>The data presented in this paper are from the 12- and 18-month evaluation surveys in January and June 2019 (Appendix 1 in the supplementary material, available at <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.107">https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.107</uri>) and other feedback, including nominations for the annual scheme awards. All participants gave informed consent for their anonymised data to be included in future research and promotional materials. As this was a service evaluation to help improve a novel mentoring scheme, ethical approval was not required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>In mid-2020, there are currently 66 active mentoring relationships participating in the PsychStart scheme at Nottingham University.

Participants reported several benefits from mentoring, including enhanced personal and professional development, improved careers and clinical knowledge, and feeling well supported. These benefits could apply to all students and to mentoring in other specialties, with the broader literature demonstrating similar benefits from other mentoring schemes.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>It is interesting that many of the qualitative comments by students highlighted generic aspects of the mentoring relationship, such as receiving personalised support, careers advice and assistance in their personal and professional development, as their favourite components of the PsychStart scheme. All students already have a personal tutor throughout the medical course, and clinical supervisors for each placement, who are also able to deliver these functions. It may be that students particularly enjoy receiving such support in the context of their desired specialty or accessing this from somebody to whom they have been closely matched on the basis of shared interests.</p><p>Many of the observed mentoring activities fulfil several selection criteria for core psychiatry training applications.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> For example, involvement in audit and quality improvement, completion of research, and demonstration of commitment to the specialty through arranging further clinical exposure and clinical electives with mentors. Hence, mentoring opportunities may increase employability and help students to maximise their chances of successful future training applications. This is likely to be an important attraction to the scheme as recruitment to core training becomes more competitive.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Potential specialty gains from PsychStart</title><p>Mentoring may also facilitate increased and broadened clinical exposure to a specialty, with many students arranging shadowing opportunities with their mentors and accessing subspecialties that are less established within the standard curriculum. This is particularly useful within psychiatry, where many subspecialties, such as forensic and perinatal psychiatry, are optional or seldom taught in medical school. The Psychiatry Early Experience Programme (PEEP) has previously demonstrated the benefits of increased psychiatry exposure for young medical students, including sustained positive attitudes towards the specialty.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> It is unclear whether such positive attitudes extend beyond those students who engage in psychiatry enrichment programmes, but over 80% of mentees felt that PsychStart had created positive publicity for the specialty within the wider medical school, suggesting that these may permeate throughout the student body. Ajaz et al previously reported that medical students often experience &#x02018;badmouthing&#x02019; or &#x02018;bashing&#x02019; of psychiatry,<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> which can deter them from entering the specialty; this highlights the importance of fostering positive attitudes and prompted the Ban the Bash campaign by the RCPsych, which aimed to identify and discourage disparaging comments about psychiatry.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> More recently, the College has focused on emphasising positive &#x02018;pull factors&#x02019; that promote selection of psychiatric careers.</p><p>The most common year for students to sign up to PsychStart is year 4, which coincides with the clinical psychiatry module; hence, clinical exposure to a specialty may prompt involvement in extra-curricular opportunities. The mentoring scheme was much more popular among women students, with 75.8% of mentees being women. This is considerably larger than the approximately 55% women on the Nottingham medical course (This information was obtained by T.H. through contact with Dr Pamela Hagan at the University of Nottingham Medical School. Permission was granted from the University of Nottingham Dean of Medical Education Professor Gill Doody). It is not clear why this discrepancy exists. Prior research has associated female gender with preferential selection of psychiatry at undergraduate level;<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> however, women have historically been less likely to receive mentorship, and to become mentors, in medical fields.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Our scheme data provide further evidence to support the utility of mentoring in improving specialty recruitment, with over one-third of students reporting an increased interest in psychiatric careers. Our data also suggest that mentoring may help to retain, as well as promote, students&#x02019; interests in particular specialties, with just under two-thirds of students reporting a sustained interest in psychiatry on the PsychStart scheme. This is particularly important given that 22% of medical students who exhibit an early interest in psychiatry lose this interest throughout their studies.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> There is evidence that these benefits also exist outside of psychiatry; for example, Dorrance et al reported that a mentoring and research initiative showcasing a career as an internist in primary care settings resulted in a higher proportion of graduates opting for internal medicine training.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, mentoring has been found to increase interest in academic careers.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Holt et al reported no significant difference in specialty choice at baseline and at their 3-year follow-up for students participating in the Psychiatry Early Experience Programme;<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> this may suggest that, although clinical shadowing may be useful, other opportunities provided by mentorship may have a greater influence on career selection. However, further follow-up and evaluation is required to determine the long-term effects of mentoring and early clinical exposure on decisions to pursue psychiatry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our scheme data have several strengths. First, to our knowledge, this is the first published report to evaluate a formal mentoring scheme for UK medical students interested in psychiatry. Second, the high response rates to the two surveys (69.1 and 70.5%) assures us that we have gained a representative sample of students on the PsychStart programme. Third, the broad range of survey responses covering all year groups at Nottingham medical school gives strength to the generalisability of our findings.</p><p>However, we recognise that these data have the following limitations. First, they are subjective, based on students&#x02019; written reports and ratings of their mentoring relationships. The nature of the design of the evaluation did not allow for further probing about the students&#x02019; perceptions and experiences of the scheme. Furthermore, students&#x02019; stated interests may not necessarily predict future actions and result in core psychiatry training applications. Second, our data were derived from a self-selecting sample of students participating in the PsychStart scheme. We were therefore unable to draw any comparisons between students who do and do not receive mentoring in psychiatry and determine whether the scheme &#x02018;adds value&#x02019; for those already interested in a career in the specialty. Finally, the maximum duration of mentoring relationships at the time of survey completion was just over 18 months; hence, we are unable to comment on the long-term effects of mentoring for this cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-4"><title>Research recommendations</title><p>We recommend that future research should examine the long-term effects of mentoring and its impact on the quantity and quality of applications to core psychiatry training. Given prior research associating mentoring with improved medical school performance and training outcomes,<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> it would additionally be useful to examine the effects of mentoring in psychiatry on exam performance in the specialty. Delineating what motivates students who do and do not sign up to such mentoring schemes, and potential logistical barriers to taking part, could provide useful insights into factors both promoting and hindering engagement with psychiatry and mentoring. Further attention should be given to the experience of mentors, especially given that the concept of &#x02018;reverse-mentoring&#x02019; is becoming increasingly recognised in the medical literature; this describes a process whereby junior medical professionals can mentor their senior colleagues, providing benefits such as enhanced understanding of digital technologies and online platforms, and improved workplace culture.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Critically, it important to understand whether receiving mentoring from a psychiatrist rather than other doctors positively influences later career choice.
