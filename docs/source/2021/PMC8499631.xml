John has been calling the ambulance service and police when intoxicated, resulting in frequent visits to his flat. Emergency services suspect that he is doing this in part because he is lonely and isolated. John has said he &#x02018;doesn't do much&#x02019; in the day, and his care coordinator confirms he goes to the shop twice a week but nothing else. Dr Alvarez asks what John has enjoyed before &#x02013; he says he remembers helping his father in the garden but &#x02018;of course, I don't have a garden now&#x02019;.

The psychiatry higher training programme has integrated &#x02018;special interest&#x02019; time, where trainees can pursue projects to the benefit of patients, Trusts and trainees alike. This could be widened to other mental health practitioners to allow all to engage in sustainability projects. A central part of empowerment should also support the growing understanding of supporting the well-being of clinicians.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>Summary</title><p>Mental health organisations must act now to prevent and adapt for the climate and ecological emergency. Clinicians&#x02019; involvement is vital for developing effective and safe sustainable models of care. There is much work to be done, and there are significant changes to be made to the system to adapt to these needs. The good news is that much can be achieved through prevention of illness, choosing low-carbon treatment strategies, controlling waste and empowering patients to be more in control of their care and treatment. The best news is that sustainable practice is also good practice.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Dr Adam Monsell</bold> is an ST5 in substance misuse services at Camden and Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust and sustainability scholar at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Dr Jacob Krzanowski</bold> is an ST6 in substance misuse servcies at South London and Maudsley Mental Health NHS Trust and an associate at the Centre for Sustainable Healthcare, UK. <bold>Dr Lisa Page</bold> is a consultant psychiatrist in liaison services at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK and Clinical Senior Lecturer in Medical Education &#x00026; Psychiatry at Brighton &#x00026; Sussex Medical School, UK. <bold>Dr Sharon Cuthbert</bold> is a consultant psychiatrist in adult inpatient services at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Dr Guy Harvey</bold> is a consultant psychiartist in adult inpatient services at Cumbria Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><sec id="nts2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cite1"><string-name><surname>Berry</surname>
