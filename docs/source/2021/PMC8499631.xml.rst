   The climate change emergency is also a mental healthcare emergency.
   We seek to provide a framework for what mental health professionals
   and organisations should do to make their practice more sustainable.

   There are ethical, legal and organisational imperatives to make
   mental healthcare more sustainable. Mental healthcare must be
   refocused with an emphasis on prevention, building social capital and
   community resilience. Patients must be empowered to manage their own
   mental health. Efficiencies should be found within the system.
   Low-carbon ways to deliver care must be found, measured and improved
   upon. Greater adaptability needs to be built into the system to
   mitigate the impact of climate change. Sustainability should be
   integrated into training programmes, and good examples of practice
   shared and celebrated.

   and adapt for the climate and ecological emergency. Sustainable
   practice is also good practice.

Climate change will increase and alter the burden of poor mental health
worldwide. Direct effects, such as floods and droughts, have been shown
to worsen a variety of mental health disorders. Indirect effects, such
as displacement of populations, are likely to compound this
trend.\ :sup:`1` There are ethical, legal and organisational imperatives
to make mental healthcare more sustainable. The climate emergency is
also a health emergency, and clinicians have a duty to act as
individuals and as part of organisations.\ :sup:`2` Sustainability is
written into the constitution of the National Health Service
(NHS),\ :sup:`3` and the Climate Change Act of 2008 legislated for a
reduction in NHS carbon emissions of 80% over 30 years.\ :sup:`4` More
recently, the NHS has made the formal commitment to become carbon
neutral by 2040.\ :sup:`5`

Mental health services are estimated to emit 1.47 million tonnes of
carbon dioxide annually.\ :sup:`6` We must act now to reshape services,
both to meet the ambitious targets set by the NHS, and to avoid runaway
consequences.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required us to think differently about how we
deliver mental healthcare, and provides an opportunity to enact changes
now consistent with sustainable future.\ :sup:`7`

.. _sec1:

What should people and organisations do?
========================================

The Consensus Statement on Sustainability in Mental Health establishes
four tenets of practicing mental healthcare sustainably (`Box
1 <#box1>`__).\ :sup:`8` These focus on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and enabling organisational, social and cultural factors that
will help patients achieve better mental health in the future. A health
service that targets its resources and empowers patients to take
ownership of their health will become more efficient, resilient and less
carbon-intensive. Box 1Tenets of sustainable mental healthcare. Prevent
mental illness, build social capital and promote individual, social and
community reliance and mental well-being.Empower patients, staff and
carers to manage their mental health.Eliminate wasteful activity.Make
use of low-carbon alternatives.

.. _sec1-1:

Focus on prevention, build social capital
-----------------------------------------

Prevention protects resources, and hence saves carbon. Preventative
healthcare is more cost-effective than a reactive approach. This is true
in mental healthcare, where preventative programmes have shown to be
effective in a wide range of common mental health problems such as
depression, anxiety and first-episode psychosis.\ :sup:`9` Prevention of
conduct disorders could save £150 000 per case in lifetime
costs.\ :sup:`10` Early intervention programmes can delay or prevent
transition to psychosis among participants,\ :sup:`11` and have
significant cost-savings.\ :sup:`12` Some preventative measures are
outside the purview of psychiatric services. Adverse childhood
experiences increase the risk of depression by four times, and suicide
attempts by 30 times,\ :sup:`13` yet mental health services are not
involved at the advent of these life events. Greater joint working
between public service bodies would achieve better long-term mental
health outcomes.

Addressing the social determinants of poor mental health can also
achieve better outcomes. The Marmot Review established that ‘the lower
one's social and economic status, the poorer one's health is likely to
be’.\ :sup:`14` Organisations should make targeted us of resources in
areas such as housing, social isolation and employment, to work to
improve social capital.

.. _sec1-1-1:

Housing
~~~~~~~

Homelessness and long-term mental illness are linked.\ :sup:`15` Models
such as Housing First have been shown to help individuals engage better
with treatment programmes, doing this at around half the cost of
traditional models.\ :sup:`16` The Critical Time Intervention programme
can also be effective in preventing homelessness on discharge from
in-patient care.\ :sup:`17`

.. _sec1-1-2:

Isolation
~~~~~~~~~

People with mental ill-health are more likely to suffer adverse
consequences of social isolation.\ :sup:`18` Recent lockdown conditions
have shown the impact of social isolation on previously well-managed
mental health conditions.\ :sup:`19` Befriending services can be
effective in improving depression,\ :sup:`20` and is highly valued by
patients. Social prescribing can also help address isolation, loneliness
and inactivity.

.. _sec1-1-3:

Employment
~~~~~~~~~~

Unemployment is associated with poor mental health,\ :sup:`21` whereas
being in employment or volunteering promotes better mental
health.\ :sup:`22,23` Individual Placement Support services have
demonstrated successes, when used, by integrating employment specialists
into community teams to support those with severe mental health problems
into work.

Addressing social determinants of mental health will enable populations
to become more resilient to the effects of climate change. Groups with
less social capital are both more likely to experience poor mental
health,\ :sup:`14` and more vulnerable to the effects of climate
change.\ :sup:`24` Conversely, a better housed, stably employed,
socially connected population will require less mental healthcare as
circumstances change.

.. _sec1-2:

Empower patients to manage their own mental health
--------------------------------------------------

A variety of opportunities exist to enable patients to take a leading
role in the management of and recovery from their conditions (`Box
2 <#box2>`__). Box 2Sustainability within a management plan.Dr Alvarez,
has been reviewing John, a 57-year-old man with depression, who drinks
alcohol regularly. John has been calling the ambulance service and
police when intoxicated, resulting in frequent visits to his flat.
Emergency services suspect that he is doing this in part because he is
lonely and isolated. John has said he ‘doesn't do much’ in the day, and
his care coordinator confirms he goes to the shop twice a week but
nothing else. Dr Alvarez asks what John has enjoyed before – he says he
remembers helping his father in the garden but ‘of course, I don't have
a garden now’. John discussed him at the team meeting and hears from the
occupational therapist about ‘Men in Sheds’, a local gardening group
coordinated by peer-support workers. Dr Alvarez contacts John's general
practitioner to establish contact with a link worker from the local
social prescribing initiative, who meets with John to enable him to
attend. After 4 weeks of attending together, John feels ready to go
himself and says it is the highlight of his week. Dr Alvarez asks John
to monitor his symptoms via an online symptom tracker, and is able to
demonstrate to John that he his mood has improved, and alcohol
consumption reduced. He is no longer calling emergency services. Dr
Alvarez and John discuss a keeping well plan, getting John to identify
what has got him better. They agree to meet again in 3 months via video
conferencing to review his progress.

.. _sec1-2-1:

Co-production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If done correctly, individual, jointly developed care planning forms an
opportunity identify what works for patients correctly first time, and
hence reduce wasted effort. This needs to be done in a non-tokenistic
way that does not marginalise patients.\ :sup:`25` Co-production must
also form an integral part of any service redevelopment.\ :sup:`26`

.. _sec1-2-2:

Self-monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technology can empower patients to manage their own symptoms. Tracking
their symptoms online or via smartphones has been shown to benefit a
variety of disorders, including anxiety, stress, alcohol and sleep
disorders, depression, suicidal behaviours and post-traumatic stress
disorder.\ :sup:`27` Use of symptom monitoring is well developed in
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, and could be expanded to
other services.

.. _sec1-2-3:

Peer support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Peer support provides excellent opportunities for patients to take
ownership of their mental health. They can reduce in-patient admissions
across a variety of diagnoses,\ :sup:`28` and can also link patients to
a social support network.\ :sup:`29`

.. _sec1-2-4:

Social prescribing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Social prescribing is a key component of personalised care,\ :sup:`30`
and provides for an opportunity to tie together many aspects of
sustainable healthcare practice. It has potential to lower the carbon
footprint of healthcare by empowering people to pursue their own
non-pharmacological solutions to their social, practical and emotional
problems.

.. _sec1-2-5:

Green and blue space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access to green and blue space can promote mental health and improve
symptoms in a variety of mental and physical disorders.\ :sup:`31` Green
space and horticultural therapy projects should be part of any hospital
build or redesign, and Trusts should identify areas where they could
form part of their existing portfolios. Green walking groups\ :sup:`32`
and activities centred on blue space both have benefits.\ :sup:`33`
Importantly, those with poor mental or physical health are least likely
to have access to green and blue space,\ :sup:`34` and efforts will be
needed to engage these groups.

.. _sec1-3:

Eliminate wasteful activity
---------------------------

Wasteful activity is a significant contributor to both the carbon
footprint and financial cost of the NHS. A leaner, smarter service will
deliver higher-value, more sustainable healthcare.

.. _sec1-3-1:

Medicine optimisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although the carbon impact of psychiatric prescription is currently
poorly understood, some quick wins exist. Using long-acting injectable
medications at the longest evidenced-based interval rarely occurs, but
could reduce the cost of prescribing by £250 per patient per year, or a
total of 170 000 kg carbon dioxide equivalent.\ :sup:`35` Psychiatry
also has considerable influence over prescribing in primary care, and
should routinely work with general practitioners to reduce
pharmaceutical waste, polypharmacy and overprescribing. There should be
greater use of structured medication reviews to work with patients to
optimise their medications.\ :sup:`36` These form further opportunities
for shared decision-making over treatment.

.. _sec1-3-2:

Concordance and treatment effectiveness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Half of all medicines dispensed are not taken as directed.\ :sup:`37` In
mental healthcare, the figure is likely to be even higher. Better
understanding the reasons for non-adherence, such as side-effects,
personal beliefs or other barriers, may go some way to reducing waste.
There may also be opportunities for patients to pursue treatment
strategies that de-emphasise the role of medication, if circumstances
permit. The open dialogue approach has been successful both in treating
symptoms of psychosis and returning patients to work, largely in the
absence of medication;\ :sup:`38` its efficacy in the UK is currently
being evaluated. In some situations, it may be possible to continue to
support people with severe mental illness who choose to not take
medications at all; so called ‘managed non-adherence’.

.. _sec1-3-3:

Reducing ‘did not attend’ rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

‘Did not attend’ rates in mental healthcare are estimated to be between
15 and 20% higher than other specialties.\ :sup:`39` Patients who miss
appointments tend to be more unwell, and have a higher chance of relapse
and hospital admission.\ :sup:`40` A reduction in missed appointments
can be obtained by gaining a better understanding of their cause, and
adapting to this in ways relevant to patients.\ :sup:`41`

.. _sec1-4:

Make use of low-carbon alternatives
-----------------------------------

Mental healthcare emissions are more evenly spread across a variety of
these direct and indirect sources than in other specialities (`Fig.
1 <#fig01>`__).\ :sup:`5` The lack of a quick fix reinforces the need
for collective action by individuals across mental health organisational
divisions. Fig. 1Mental healthcare carbon emissions compared with other
healthcare sectors. Relative carbon emissions of healthcare sectors
(kgCO2e).

.. _sec1-4-1:

Low-carbon treatment choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clinicians need to be aware of the carbon impact of their treatment
choices, and offer low-carbon treatment choices when possible. There is
a need for a better understanding, and the NHS should work with
pharmaceutical companies to make this readily available for clinicians.
Meanwhile, evidence-based alternatives, such as electronic
cognitive–behavioural therapy and other web-based psychology programmes,
are available for disorders such as depression,\ :sup:`42`
anxiety\ :sup:`43` and insomnia.\ :sup:`44` These have as little as a
fifth of the carbon emissions of face-to-face cognitive–behavioural
therapy (230 kg *v*. 1100 kg), and a quarter of the carbon emissions of
a course of antidepressant treatment with psychiatrist follow-up
(900 kg).\ :sup:`45`

.. _sec1-4-2:

Active transport and reduction in vehicle emissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staff and patient travel forms a significant component of mental
healthcare carbon emissions. Clean and zero emissions fleet vehicles,
cycling and other types of active travel are all part of the solution;
mental health organisations must take steps to procure and promote
these. The 2019 Royal College of Psychiatrists sustainability prize
winners from Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust ran a project to
reduce their transport emissions, using online meetings, cycling or
walking, and car sharing, saving 22 216 kg carbon dioxide equivalent
over a year.\ :sup:`46`

.. _sec1-4-3:

Energy use
~~~~~~~~~~

Mental health organisations should invest in smart energy systems, and
to procure their energy from the greenest possible sources. By
installing a piece of software that remotely shut down computers not in
use overnight, NHS Oldham was expected to save over 800 000 kg carbon
dioxide equivalent and £41 000 in the first year.\ :sup:`47` Clinicians
can identify energy-saving schemes in their workplaces. The Centre for
Sustainable Healthcare run the Green Ward competition, offering guidance
and support for sustainable schemes, including energy use.

.. _sec1-4-4:

Waste and recycling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although a relatively small component of the overall carbon impact of
the NHS, interventions involving waste often are the most definable and
easily engaged-with green programmes. The Royal Surrey Hospital's
recycling programme grew from a group of nurses carrying home recyclable
waste into a dedicated recycling centre for the Trust, and 60
‘sustainability champions’.\ :sup:`48`

.. _sec1-4-5:

Food and catering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mental health organisations must work to offer their in-patients and
staff members sustainable and healthy food options. North Bristol NHS
Trust successfully worked with their wholesalers to source all of their
ingredients within a 50-mile radius.\ :sup:`47` Clinical staff can do
much via feedback to on-site catering options to include more
sustainable options, or taking steps to change their own diet at work.

.. _sec1-5:

Plan, measure and improve
-------------------------

Transitioning toward sustainable models of care requires unprecedented
coordination between and within mental health organisations and their
local partners. Success depends on a structured, coordinated strategy
and ways of measuring and improving changes.

.. _sec1-5-1:

Green Plans
~~~~~~~~~~~

All mental health Trusts are required to have a board-approved Green
Plan, but their importance to organisations currently varies.
Sustainability should be an integral part of mental health
organisations’ strategic approach and should have executive-level
buy-in. An effective Green Plan will be led by a Board member and have
wide representation. The Sustainable Development Unit and NHS England
have published guidance on how to develop a Green Plan.\ :sup:`49`

.. _sec1-5-2:

Carbon footprint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sustainable Development Unit has tools for NHS Trusts to measure and
reduce their carbon footprint in procurement, and have forthcoming plans
for other divisions. An ‘ethical procurement’ tool is also available.
The Royal College of General Practitioners has produced a ‘Green Impact
for Health Toolkit’, enabling general practices to audit their practice
– a similar toolkit should exist for mental healthcare organisations.

.. _sec1-5-3:

Quality improvement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quality improvement is an effective framework to achieve sustainability
aims. One advantage of the quality improvement model is that it seeks to
understand local systems first, making it more effective at solving
local problems. It is also a ‘bottom-up’ approach, fostering a sense of
ownership and ambition among staff. The Centre for Sustainable
Healthcare have adapted the quality improvement model for
sustainability, which can be used in mental healthcare settings (`Fig.
2 <#fig02>`__). Fig. 2Applying sustainable clinical practice principles

Healthcare under creative commons licence CC BY-SA 4.0.

.. _sec1-6:

Adapt the system
----------------

Climate change will bring about longer-term shifts in patterns of need,
mediated through changing populations, economic hardship, increased
social division\ :sup:`1` and poorer physical health.\ :sup:`50` In the
UK, climate change is leading to more flooding and heatwave events,
which have adverse impacts on mental health.\ :sup:`51–53` In the global
South and elsewhere, additional hazards such as wildfires, droughts,
hurricanes and cyclones, are recognised drivers of poor mental
health,\ :sup:`54` particularly for those with pre-existing
difficulties.\ :sup:`55`

Clinicians must prepare for this change and increase in mental disorder.
There will need to be flexibility built into the system, as the full
effects of climate change on the population are unknown.

.. _sec1-7:

Equipping psychiatrists to become sustainable practitioners, now and in the future
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organisations must play the central role in directing a shift in the
organisation and delivery of clinical services. However, the
normalisation of such practice through education, knowledge sharing via
networks, and empowerment, is essential to allowing clinicians to play
their part.

.. _sec1-7-1:

Training
~~~~~~~~

There is broad interest among psychiatry trainees and medical students
in becoming sustainable practitioners, but many do not see it as a core
feature of their role as trainee doctors. Sustainability should be
integrated into training and established as a central responsibility of
a psychiatrist. Medical schools such as Lancaster Medical School are
already embedding sustainability into their curriculum,\ :sup:`56` and
sustainable practice should be made part of e-portfolio and annual
review of competency progression commitments. There are also broader
arguments to place sustainability at the heart of the General Medical
Council's duty of a doctor Gold Guide.

.. _sec1-7-2:

Sharing good practice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attendees at conferences and meetings should routinely expect to see a
focus on sustainable healthcare, as has been the case at several
regional conferences to date. Video conferencing opens up more
opportunities to do this in a sustainable way. Networks such as
PsySustnet provide an additional resource to exchange learning. Awards
such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ annual sustainability prize
have successfully celebrated outstanding achievement in sustainable
mental healthcare.

.. _sec1-7-3:

Empowering employees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mental health organisations should enable their employees to engage with
sustainable activities, and bring their knowledge and energy to their
workplaces. The psychiatry higher training programme has integrated
‘special interest’ time, where trainees can pursue projects to the
benefit of patients, Trusts and trainees alike. This could be widened to
other mental health practitioners to allow all to engage in
sustainability projects. A central part of empowerment should also
support the growing understanding of supporting the well-being of
clinicians.

.. _sec2:

Summary
=======

Mental health organisations must act now to prevent and adapt for the
climate and ecological emergency. Clinicians’ involvement is vital for
developing effective and safe sustainable models of care. There is much
work to be done, and there are significant changes to be made to the
system to adapt to these needs. The good news is that much can be
achieved through prevention of illness, choosing low-carbon treatment
strategies, controlling waste and empowering patients to be more in
control of their care and treatment. The best news is that sustainable
practice is also good practice.
