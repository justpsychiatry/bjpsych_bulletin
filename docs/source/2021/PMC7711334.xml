Attending and presenting at a journal club are recommended for all trainees, being a workplace-based assessment (WPBA) for core trainees within their curriculum and required for annual review of competency progression (ARCP).<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Monitoring of attendance and reinforcement of its importance are likely to vary within UK deaneries and internationally.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1"><title>Journal clubs of the past</title><p>Doctors assembling to review current literature has been recorded as far back as 1875.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, recent difficulties in engaging doctors in journal clubs have been discussed.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In 2009, Agell wrote of a &#x02018;journal club syndrome,&#x02019; in which he reported an observed correlation between reported &#x02018;mishaps&#x02019; preventing trainees from engaging in the learning process and the timing of their scheduled presentations.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This somewhat cynical view highlights the long-standing anxieties and struggles with engagement that trainees might face.</p><p>In 2008, Deenadayalan et al recommended establishing an overarching goal for a journal club which is reviewed and agreed by participants, recording and expecting attendance, establishing sustainable leadership with access to a statistical expert as needed and providing incentives such as food.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Other aspects, such as article choice, are also specified. In psychiatry, Swift built on these strategies, highlighting the importance of structure, clear aims, a social aspect for the group and discussing selection of the facilitator (with critical appraisal and teaching skills but also able to provide enthusiasm and approachability for more junior colleagues).<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Moving away from the traditional format by introducing &#x02018;evidence-based journal clubs&#x02019; has been suggested.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Such sessions would address a specific clinical problem by referring to available literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>Journal clubs online: what we know so far</title><p>Although the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid move to online learning, journal clubs have existed in the virtual world for some time. These can take the form either of synchronous learning, when a teacher is present at the same time as students, or of asynchronous learning, when a teacher directs study but is not present when the learning takes place.</p><p>Many asynchronous options for journal review have been developed, supporting the face-to-face meetings. MacLaren et al have discussed the internet possibilities, using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter handles and Mentimeter as a means to widen potential journal club participation and support learning.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Other e-sources are available for accessing mental health information, an example being the Mental Elf, which has used blogs, social media and gamification to incentivise users.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>There has been a recent surge of asynchronous Twitter journal clubs,<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> in which participants contribute via tweets over a specified time period (typically between 1&#x000a0;h and 1 week), providing free participation, open journal access, time efficiency and a diverse international forum for discussion. Instructions for those wishing to set up an asynchronous journal club can involve a number of steps, including incorporating other social media platforms and considering the most convenient time for its target audience, to make their establishment accessible to all.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Plante et al note that content may be unregulated and that some might struggle to learn from reviewing past discussions, and suggest that Wiki Journal Club (a website that allows collaboration in writing summaries, critical analysis and reviews of chosen papers, similar to Wikipedia) overcomes these barriers by providing editorial and professional moderation, easily referenced and referred to.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> MacRae et al found a significant improvement in critical appraisal skills among participants of their surgical journal club, compared with a control group, but acknowledged that those involved in a Twitter journal club are likely to be more motivated than the general surgeon population.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Synchronous online journal clubs have had less exploration. Among Lin &#x00026; Sherbino's suggested steps for setting up an online journal club is the added possibility of &#x02018;live&#x02019; video panel discussions using technology such as Google &#x02018;Hangouts on Air&#x02019; and YouTube.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> More recently, the <italic>BJPsych</italic> has collaborated with university psychiatric societies to help successfully launch live virtual journal clubs, with student presentations followed by expert-panel discussion.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A similar approach has been followed with dental trainees, highlighting the benefits of accessibility, ease of interaction and effective learning.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Although additional online options may increase the potential for journal club participation, they are unlikely to suit all trainees. Twitter is the most popular form of social media communication among healthcare professionals,<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> but the exact prevalence of use among doctors, or more specifically trainees, is to our knowledge not reported. If medical education becomes dependent on social media platforms, the risk is that some will be alienated or simply not reached.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3"><title>Techniques for maintaining engagement with online learning</title><p>Difficulties in engaging learners online are a recognised challenge for educators; traditional face-to-face teaching methods cannot simply be adopted in the online environment.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Additional considerations are needed (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>).

The instructor could consider using diverse examples when setting problems/tasks and fostering social relationships within the group, while still respecting the student's own responsibility for driving their learning and seeking help.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Forcing some students to contribute, when not part of a shared collaborative process, could endanger their autonomy and motivation.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4"><title>Recent learning following COVID-19 restrictions</title><p>In 2020, since the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatry training has depended on online technology to replace all face-to-face journal club meetings. Within months, our use of platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams became the &#x02018;new normal&#x02019; and the only option for teaching and networking. Although some participants were already familiar with the array of online options, many may not have been and could still be struggling to keep up.</p><p>Within South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, we have continued to run a weekly journal club using the virtual platform of Microsoft Teams, supported by a WhatsApp group to offer further discussion as needed. Efforts were made to boost the effectiveness of the journal club by recruiting additional higher trainees to support the sessions, increasing the level of support offered to the lead presenter and making particular efforts during journal club meetings to encourage all to contribute. Although the numbers in the virtual room have been noticeably higher than those in face-to-face meetings before March 2020 &#x02013; up to two or three times as many &#x02013; engagement levels have been difficult to measure, with many of those present in the virtual room not taking an active part. In the absence of visual cues, with most turning off their screen camera and not using the &#x02018;chat&#x02019; function, we struggle to assess who is actively engaging in the group and who finds it useful. Several trainees have commented on missing the social aspect of the group.</p><p>As it has become unclear how long COVID-19 restrictions will continue, morale has declined. The initial high level of discussion has not been maintained; not all trainees have appeared confident to engage, either by speaking openly, using the written chat/Q&#x00026;A function or through the WhatsApp group. This experience is, of course, likely to vary between different hospitals, trusts and deaneries, depending on the confidence of trainees, as well as the ethos and culture of the organisation.</p><p>Reflections and feedback from trainees are continuously sought and contribute to future planning (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>), but we are aware that those most disengaged from the process are less likely to communicate their needs.

There is no current alternative within the RCPsych curriculum that offers these opportunities, and journal club remains a WPBA for core trainees.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The current pandemic reminds us how critical evidence-based medicine is to our practice, with a flurry of new research on COVID-19, and the need to recognise how new research should be integrated into practice. The transition to online journal clubs now requires a new set of organiser and administrator skills, which is a challenge in some departments. Even before 2020, journal clubs were struggling with participant engagement.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Online journal clubs might be embraced by those with research or education focus; but there is a high risk that others could feel excluded. Others might be starting to get online fatigue.</p><p>Considering techniques for effective engagement in online teaching can enhance our ability to facilitate journal clubs.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The use of clinical problems and specific tasks, similar to the previously introduced evidence-based journal clubs, may provide additional relevance and authenticity for learners.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Considering the diverse range of learner needs and preferences is advised.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The online platform potentially supports educators in managing diversity by improving accessibility, in particular for those shielding or working on a different clinical site.

Trainees have fed back that they appreciate additional guidance on presentation style, paper choice and additional resources. They have expressed a preference for flexibility, not defining the style of presentation and allowing the option of multiple communication forms (speaking in person, typing in the written &#x02018;chat&#x02019;, as well as using WhatsApp and other social media platforms). A challenge of measuring active participation remains, as the administrative resources required to record contributions might not be feasible within all training programmes. Forcing contribution could endanger trainee autonomy,<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> although it should be recognised that it is an expected and important part of the trainee curriculum.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>This article can only be the start of a more complex discussion and re-evaluation of the function, purpose and delivery of online journal clubs and the part they play in the psychiatry curriculum, as well as considering the level of support provided to trainees and by whom.
