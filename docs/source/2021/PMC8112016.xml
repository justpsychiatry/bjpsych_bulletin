They are a successful facet of the Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x02019; #ChoosePsychiatry campaign<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and, if well designed, can improve attitudes to psychiatry among medical students.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, as summer schools are primarily aimed at medical students and foundation doctors, opportunities to experience psychiatry while at school remain limited. A psychiatry scheme for school leavers<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and work experience placements focusing on mental health for A-level students<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> have been reported with positive outcomes. However, these examples concentrate mostly on those already committed to applying to medical school. Such programmes, especially those with entrance processes requiring evidence of prior interest, tend to favour those already motivated to work in psychiatry. Thus, there is recruitment potential in prioritising those that have little prior knowledge of the subject.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Studies have shown that medical students reporting an interest in psychiatry before medical school are more likely to subspecialise in it in the future.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Therefore, the evidence suggests that a summer school for students following their GCSEs would allow them to obtain valuable early experience of psychiatry and hopefully garner a potential untapped interest in psychiatry as a career. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experiences of GCSE students attending a psychiatry summer school, with a secondary aim of assessing its influence on attitudes to mental illness and perception of psychiatry as a career.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="other"><title>Setting</title><p>The summer school was a joint venture by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) and the local mental health trust, South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.

Those who began with a limited or negative perspective indicated that prior misconceptions had been challenged and questions had been answered. Psychiatry was compared favourably with other areas of medicine, and psychiatrists as a group were looked upon positively.
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;<italic>The treatment of the patients has been fulfilling to them [psychiatrists] personally as well.

Some had even forged interests in specific subspecialties.

This indicates that campaigns and media interest<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> do not necessarily translate into awareness of career opportunities, which must be a separate strand of work in parallel with stigma reduction. The improvement in understanding and awareness shown by the time of the discussion group demonstrates the direct effect of the summer school.</p><p>Although clinical contact has not always been an essential factor in improving attitudes towards psychiatry,<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> our experience was that witnessing the doctor&#x02013;patient relationship and hearing about the effects of the work of a psychiatrist were key strengths of the summer school identified by the participants. In keeping with medical student and trainee experience,<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> it appears that role models are also important early on to enable students to visualise their own potential next steps.</p><p>This evaluation adds to the body of evidence that educational interventions can change the attitudes of adolescents towards mental illness.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Although this was not the primary purpose of the summer school, it was a welcome side-effect. It is noted that not all subscales of the CAMI showed significant change pre and post course. However, given how little current comparative data exist on attitudes to mental illness in our population group, further research is required to fully explain these results.</p><p>The Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x02019; current recruitment strategy<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> is inclusive of school students, having aimed to roll out regional sixth-form career events by the end of 2019. We propose that GCSE student events are an area worth exploring further. These may serve to inspire students who perhaps have a less fixed commitment to one career path, have not considered medicine previously or have little knowledge of the scope of psychiatry and still have time to change their A level choices. We felt the following aspects were crucial to making the summer school accessible to a range of students and meeting the national efforts to widen participation.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>

Our qualitative data from the discussion group did not reach saturation, demonstrating that not all potential data were garnered from this aspect of the evaluation. More discussion groups would be required in further research. In addition, although our cohort comprised a mixed demographic from a diverse part of south-east London, even if they had a variety of motivations, expectations and career interests, the students were still a self-selecting group, with all agreeing to attend a week-long summer school on psychiatry. We did not collect information such as family history of higher education and parental occupations, but doing so would help to assess whether students from all socioeconomic backgrounds were accessing the summer school. A barrier to transferability is that areas without potential funding from a major educational institution such as the IoPPN and a large pool of academics and clinicians to draw upon may find it challenging to provide this intensity of programme for a relatively small number of participants. Finally, as this is a little-studied population, it is unclear which assessment tool is most suited to explore school students&#x02019; attitudes towards psychiatry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Targeting students at this early stage appears to be an under-utilised intervention for psychiatry recruitment, and one which offers exciting potential for further work. The participants reported universally positive experiences of the summer school and demonstrated a shift towards considering psychiatry as a future career. There was also a valuable side-effect of more positive attitudes towards those with mental illness. We plan to repeat this summer school in future years and undertake longer-term follow-up in regard to participants&#x02019; A-level and degree choices and ongoing interest in psychiatry as a career.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Clementine Wyke</bold> is a CT3 in Psychiatry at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Maudsley Hospital, London, UK. <bold>Glori-Louise de Bernier</bold> is a CT3 in Psychiatry at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Maudsley Hospital, London, UK. <bold>Chun Chiang Sin Fai Lam</bold> is a Consultant Liaison Psychiatrist at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King's College Hospital, London, UK. <bold>Clare Holt</bold> is a General Adult and Old Age Psychiatry Registrar at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Maudsley Hospital, London, UK. <bold>Sophie Butler</bold> is a General Adult Psychiatry Registrar, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Maudsley Hospital, London, UK. <bold>Anto Praveen Rajkumar Rajamani</bold> is a Clinical Associate Professor in Old Age Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. <bold>Charlotte Wilson Jones</bold> is Director of Undergraduate Psychiatry &#x00026; Director of Mental Health Education (MBBS) at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &#x00026; Neuroscience: Academic Division, UK.</p></notes><notes id="nts2" notes-type="other"><title>Author contributions</title><p>C.W. helped to organise and run the summer school and assisted in the drafting of the paper.
