The authors provide a welcome update of evidence and reasoning for the
‘gender critical’ position, and the problems with the ‘gender affirming’
position that the Royal College of Psychiatrists adopted in 2018. Their
argument might have been even stronger if it had included an account of
recent complaints about pressures against free enquiry and expression in
this area.\ :sup:`1` Such pressures may partly account for the paucity
of published gender critical clinical and scientific research. Neither
did the authors mention the professional misconduct of a ‘gender
affirming’ consultant psychiatrist in a London teaching hospital, which
was brought to the public's attention in 2007 by the campaigning
journalist Julie Bindel.\ :sup:`2` Or, specifically, the influence of
the pharmaceutical industry, although that was implied in at least one
of the references they cited.\ :sup:`3` However, some of their reasoning
appears to lean towards an extreme gender critical position, which is
inconsistent with mainstream psychiatric practice. They write that
‘there is little to no convincing evidence to support fundamental
differences between the brains of females and males’. But a lack of
reliable neurobiological pathology is true of most psychiatric
disorders, for which psychiatrists routinely prescribe drugs and other
physical treatments, quite often coercively. Again, ‘As a pure
subjective experience, [gender identity] may be overwhelming and
powerful but is also unverifiable and unfalsifiable’. Psychiatric
disorders are mainly diagnosed on the basis of what patients report
about their ‘subjective experience’, so the requirement that transgender
patients must provide substantial additional ‘verification’ of their
experiences also suggests that the authors have adopted a double
standard. Do they propose that patients with depression or
post-traumatic stress disorder demonstrate that their problems are
‘falsifiable’ before they can receive treatment? The authors attempt to
distance themselves from ‘conversion therapy’, but many gender dysphoric
patients will not find their arguments convincing. They claim ‘there is
little evidence’ that transgender conversion therapy ‘is taking place in
the UK’, but the 2018 National LGBT Survey found that 13% of UK trans
respondents ‘had been offered’ conversion therapy, compared with 7% of
‘cisgender’ respondents.\ :sup:`4` Conversion therapy for homosexuality
is closely associated with psychoanalysis.\ :sup:`5` The American
Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of disorders
in 1973, with strong opposition from psychoanalysts. It took nearly
three decades for the London-based International Psychoanalytical
Association (IPA) to act similarly, in 2002. It seems likely that the
IPA continues to tolerate the view that homosexuality is a disorder,
treatable by psychoanalysis.\ :sup:`6,7` The authors allude to ‘complex
intrapsychic conflicts’ but fail to explain what they mean by this or
provide a reference. This suggests an undeclared allegiance to
psychoanalysis. Some British psychoanalysts appear to see transgender
patients as a growth opportunity.\ :sup:`8` The gender critical views of
the ex-Tavistock London psychoanalyst Marcus Evans have been quoted by
the BBC\ :sup:`9` and the *BMJ*,\ :sup:`10` while journalists have
failed to scrutinise his implied claim that psychoanalysis can provide
valid clinical opinion. Such scrutiny is especially necessary given the
problematic relation of psychoanalysis to homosexuality and its wider
history of evading scrutiny of its claims to therapeutic efficacy,
validity\ :sup:`11` and safety.\ :sup:`12` Psychiatry should retain its
gatekeeping role for transgender patients seeking physical treatments or
legal gender change, but extreme gender critical views, which at present
appear to include special pleading for psychoanalysis, would undermine
the consent necessary for that role to be effective.
