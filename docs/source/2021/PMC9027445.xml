</p><p>The psychological benefits of international travel, especially for tourism purposes, have been largely ignored until relatively recently in the travel medicine literature, whose focus to date has been on the mitigation of travel health risks through vaccination and pre-travel physical health counselling. The unique challenges faced by travellers with diagnosed mental illness are rarely addressed in the pre-travel medical consultation. Furthermore, travel may precipitate first clinical episodes of mental illness in an unfamiliar environment. Travel medicine physicians without basic knowledge of psychiatry are often poorly prepared to anticipate the likelihood of decompensation of mental illness in this cohort of travellers. We propose travel psychiatry as an emerging area of both research and clinical interest. This article draws on the sparse available literature and over 40 years of combined clinical experience in psychiatry (B.H.) and travel medicine (G.F.) to describe the effects of international travel, both positive and negative, on people with mental illness, with the aim of advocating for an integrated approach to supporting individuals with mental illness when travelling abroad.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1"><title>Mental health challenges of international travel</title><p>Travel, even with a recreational motivation, is inherently stressful and the perceived stressful impact is likely a product of the travel itinerary, destination, activities and individual traveller susceptibility. Felkai &#x00026; Kurimay reported that 11.3% of travellers experience some symptoms of mental illness during travel, with 0.3% of travellers experiencing an acute psychotic episode.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Indeed, incidence data reveal that acute psychotic episodes account for one-fifth of travel-related mental illnesses. Travellers who are deemed medically fit to travel and who have no history of mental disorder may develop acute <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> psychosis during their trip. The cumulative effects of travel-induced stress, culture shock, inappropriate alcohol intake and/or recreational substance use, circadian rhythm disruption, underlying brain pathology and physical illness have been implicated as contributing factors in the development of first-time psychosis during travel.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Another subgroup of travel-related psychosis occurs during travel to destinations with high religious, cultural and aesthetic value, so-called high-valence venues.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, many of these episodes occur against a background of a pre-existing psychotic illness. Airault &#x00026; Valk describe a number of specific destination syndromes, including Jerusalem syndrome, Stendhal syndrome and Paris syndrome.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In addition, travel to high-altitude destinations is increasingly regarded as an additional risk factor for the development of acute psychotic episodes and an increased risk of both suicidal ideation and completed suicide.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Misuse of alcohol and/or psychoactive substances among international travellers may be associated with an exacerbation of existing mental illness and could precipitate an acute psychotic episode.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Physicians should consequently be mindful about their patients travelling abroad for the purpose of seeking therapeutic or recreational drugs. Drug tourism, whereby tourists cross international borders for the purpose of obtaining or using psychoactive substances, is associated with significant adverse health effects, including drug-induced psychosis, unintentional physical injury, risky sexual behaviour and criminal acts.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition to drugs of misuse, medications used in travel medicine (such as mefloquine for malaria chemoprophylaxis) can potentially trigger acute psychotic episodes in people with a previous or undiagnosed mental illness.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Anxiety symptoms are common in individuals engaging in travel. The sense of uncontrollability and inherent unpredictability presented by travel may cause travellers to develop anxiety symptoms or worsen an existing anxiety disorder. Culture shock is a travel phenomenon that exposes travellers to the risk of anxiety symptoms, in addition to confusion, a sense of isolation, rejection and deprivation due to cultural differences experienced while abroad. Patients may feel overwhelmed when immersed in an unfamiliar destination and struggle to make the necessary adaptations to acclimatise to local customs and cultural norms. Moreover, travelling abroad inevitably leads to a lack of daily structural routine, separation from social supports in some cases and a lack of support, which can precipitate poor adherence to prescribed psychotropic medications. Furthermore, there is evidence that jet lag can exert a debilitating effect on travellers with mental illness, with sleep loss being demonstrated to increase the risk of episodes of (hypo)mania in individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This may be significant in international travel if the patient encounters circadian rhythm disruption and other stressors that result in sleep disturbance.</p><p>Where an individual develops an acute episode of mental illness, receiving appropriate intervention in a timely fashion can be challenging for a number of reasons, including problems communicating health difficulties to clinicians, cultural differences, poorly established diagnoses and lack of clarity in relation to the psychiatric history of the traveller. Furthermore, difficulties may arise if there is delay in the diagnosis of physical illness, such as hypoglycaemia, epileptic aura or hypothyroidism, which may initially present with alterations in mental health. Repatriation to the home country where patients can receive specialised treatment from their multidisciplinary mental health team in a familiar environment may be the most appropriate intervention.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, repatriation for psychiatric reasons can be a particularly complex undertaking requiring, in many cases, medical escort by a suitably trained mental health professional(s) and stabilisation of the person's mental health before costly aeromedical evacuation that may not be covered by travel health insurance.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>Is travel advisable for people with mental illness?</title><p>Although it is reasonable to postulate that leisure activities abroad may be beneficial for people with mental illness, research is lacking in this area. One qualitative study from The Netherlands explored how engaging in travel contributes positively to the mental rehabilitation of psychiatric patients.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Material was collected from participant observation involving eleven travellers with severe and enduring chronic mental illness who were accompanied by four psychiatric nurses during two trips. Many positive experiences were reported, including maintenance of social contact; the opportunity to develop foreign language skills; enrichment of life resulting from enjoyment and cherishable memories; positive influence on self-esteem; and a departure from the monotonies of daily routine life.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The research also provided a learning environment outside of psychiatric institutions for the nurses involved. Some travellers required the nurses&#x02019; support in managing psychotropic medications and some activities of daily living. We have recently reported similar positive findings from semi-structured interviews conducted with a series of patients with chronic psychotic illnesses who engaged in travel independently, on their own or with friends.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The putative mental health benefits of &#x02018;prescribed travel&#x02019; should be balanced against the risks in less-supported, lone travellers of developing suicidal ideation or experiencing exacerbation of mental illness. This may potentially arise from unexpected travel-related stressors, including, for example, confrontations at airport security stations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3"><title>Travel mental health recommendations</title><p>Travel psychiatry has a promising future as an integrated subspecialty of both psychiatry and travel medicine. Novel research will help to establish a stronger evidence base for clinical recommendations aimed at promoting mental health during travel.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We recommend that clinicians be aware of the psychological stress and exacerbating factors that patients encounter during foreign travel and encourage patients to attend a pre-travel medical consultation in order to agree on preventive strategies (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>).

This would advance our understanding of the interaction of travel and mental illness in a variety of traveller groups and travel settings. Travel psychiatry should involve close cooperation between mental health professionals and travel medicine practitioners, with ample scope for collaborative patient-centred research. Travel medicine practitioners should receive enhanced training on the psychiatric aspects of travel: travel-related psychological stressors, the impact of travel on pre-existing disorders and the potential for first-time episodes of mental illness during travel, as well as the importance of timely consultation with a travel psychiatrist.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="other" id="nts1"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Gerard Flaherty</bold> is a professor at the School of Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway, Ireland and an adjunct professor at the School of Medicine, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. <bold>Shang Yuin Chai</bold> is a final year medical student at the School of Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway, Ireland. <bold>Brian Hallahan</bold> is a senior lecturer at the School of Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway and a consultant psychiatrist at the Galway Roscommon Mental Health Services, University Hospital Galway, Ireland.</p></notes><notes notes-type="other" id="nts2"><title>Authorship contributions</title><p>G.F. was responsible for conception of the work.
