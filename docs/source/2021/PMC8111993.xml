The use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is not commonly considered for this condition. We describe a patient with severe depression, psychomotor retardation, delusions and weight loss who responded to ECT with good control of her symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec_a2"><title>Results</title><p>Both our case and the literature appear to confirm the efficacy of ECT in the treatment of depression in Huntington's disease and suggest that other psychiatric manifestations of Huntington's are also responsive.</p></sec><sec id="sec_a3"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>ECT is an effective and safe treatment that should be considered earlier in the course of the disease in cases that show limited response to pharmacological therapy. It should also be considered as an adjunct to medical therapy that may simplify polypharmacy and allow better control in patients with debilitating psychiatric manifestations of the disease. There is limited and conflicting evidence for its efficacy in chorea.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Electroconvulsive therapy</kwd><kwd>organic syndromes</kwd><kwd>psychotic disorders</kwd><kwd>clinical neurology</kwd><kwd>polypharmacy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><table-count count="5"/><ref-count count="20"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1"><title>Case report</title><p>Seven years ago, a 57-year-old woman with a family history of Huntington's disease presented with depression, changes in personality, apathy, anxiety, poor memory and clumsiness. Her genetics confirmed Huntington's disease, with a CAG repeat number of 17/46. Over the subsequent 4 years, her condition was marked by psychiatric symptoms and mild chorea, which responded well to tetrabenazine 25&#x000a0;mg once daily, reaching 25&#x000a0;mg twice daily by 2014. Her mood was controlled with citalopram followed by sertraline. Her main complaints were bouts of introversion and tearfulness, but she remained socially engaged with friends. By early 2015, her swallowing had ostensibly become problematic. However, a speech and language assessment and a gastroscopy determined that her swallowing was normal. By spring 2016, she was starting to fall often, with worsening athetoid movements and increased somnolence. These changes led to a switch in medication to olanzapine at 15&#x000a0;mg per day and an increase in her dose of sertraline to 100&#x000a0;mg a day.</p><p>By summer of 2017, her choreoathetoid movements had worsened and were accompanied by weight loss and a deterioration in her mood. She required a short in-patient stay for fluids via a nasogastric tube. A psychiatric review diagnosed her with a depressive psychosis with retarded affect, mood-congruent delusions and auditory command hallucinations. She believed she did not deserve to eat and drink, and the command hallucinations ordered her not to do so. She had extracampine hallucinations, sensing people at the end of her garden. In light of her clinical state of emaciation and the requirement for support, a trial of bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was suggested for her depressive psychosis. A twice-weekly regimen was started, with the aim of optimising seizure length to between 30 and 60&#x000a0;s. In winter of 2017, she received an initial 12 courses of biweekly bilateral ECT treatments using between 75 and 150&#x000a0;mC. Her initial response was favourable and she became euthymic, with remission of her psychomotor retardation, but her psychotic symptoms persisted in the form of command hallucinations despite developing insight. Her delusion of guilt also resolved and, by the tenth dose of ECT, she started to eat and drink again. The initial course of treatment was complete by early February 2018 and, with the exception of her hallucinations, her psychiatric symptoms ceased and insight was retained.</p><p>However, the persistence of psychotic symptoms in the absence of a significant mood component led to an additional 12 sessions of bilateral ECT (administered biweekly with 150&#x02013;225&#x000a0;mC; maintenance treatment consisting of bilateral 150&#x02013;300&#x000a0;mC treatment biweekly continued into late 2019) with the aim of eradicating the hallucinations. She then developed a respiratory tract infection, which led to a relapse in her psychiatric symptoms with agitation, hallucinations, and marked choreoathetosis and dyskinesia that led to the reintroduction of tetrabenazine. Despite this setback, she did improve following the last 12 doses of ECT. This course was completed in late spring 2019. She was kept on maintenance ECT once per week, with partial remission of the auditory hallucinations, which had reduced in frequency and no longer distressed her. There was a subsequent increase in the frequency of the hallucinations, with preservation of insight, and a corresponding reduction in ECT to fortnightly. She has remained stable on this regimen to date. Her involuntary movements have also improved over that time, although she remains on tetrabenazine, haloperidol and sertraline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><p>A literature search of PubMed for &#x02018;Electroconvulsive therapy and Huntington's&#x02019; and &#x02018;ECT and Huntington's&#x02019; led to the discovery of 20 papers, 18 of which were in English.

Six patients in total were diagnosed at the time of presentation, although five of them were diagnosed prior to 2013. For example, Beale et al's patient had choreiform movements (and no psychiatric manifestations) from the age of 35, but was not diagnosed until the age of 56 in 1995.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, this apparent lag after the introduction of genetic testing is likely to reflect the 16-year gap between Beale et al's paper in 1995 and those of Merida-Puga et al and Nakano et al in 2011 and 2013, respectively.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Merida-Puga et al's patient was diagnosed following postpartum psychosis and a family history suggestive of Huntington's in her father; she went on to have ECT for catatonia.

There were universally favourable outcomes in the use of ECT for this purpose. It was reported to be successful in most cases, and the patients who were reported to relapse did so on shorter courses of ECT.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, these were early reports, and there have been numerous subsequent reports of relatively short courses with no relapse.

This improvement often paralleled the response to ECT of depression, suicidality and psychosis. Two of these cases were resolved by relatively short courses of ECT (five treatments for Ranen et al's fourth patient &#x02013; though their condition was, surprisingly, described as refractory &#x02013; and seven treatments for Cusin et al's second patient). However, the presence of catatonia was refractory in the remaining two patients. Both Ranen et al's second patient (who relapsed repeatedly) and Merida-Puga et al's patient<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (who required withdrawal from long-acting antipsychotics) needed extended ECT courses (4 years for Ranen et al's patient but just over 3 months of an in-patient stay for the latter) to resolve the catatonia, with 35 and 42 ECT treatments, respectively. Merida-Puga et al's patient had a Busch&#x02013;Francis catatonia score of 26 (total severity) on first admission, falling to 4 after a second hospital admission and discharge.</p><p>Our patient required repeated doses of ECT following a relapse of psychosis over 2 years. Eventually, she showed a partial response, with improvements in her mobility and psychomotor retardation. She started to gain weight, although her delusions persisted. Improved gait was reported in six cases, including Lewis et al and the first, fourth, fifth and sixth patients of Cusin et al, who had bilateral frontotemporal and right unilateral (RUL) placement, respectively.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Disorders of eating and/or speech were mentioned for a total of ten patients.

Both dysarthria and dysphagia were reported for two patients (Cusin et al's fourth and fifth patients).

Improvement was documented in three cases (Beale et al, Petit et al and Shah et al), although five were described as showing no change (Ranen et al, Lewis et al, Nakano et al, Cusin et al's fifth patient and Adrissi et al's first patient). In two cases, chorea was described as worse (Adrissi et al's second patient and Evans et al). In the remaining four patients, no details were given, despite this symptom initially having been described as present.</p><p>Only one patient was treated with ECT specifically for chorea.

Following a favourable response of the chorea to ECT, a low dose of tetrabenazine was reintroduced with good effect and had no further influence on her mood. Her gait and mobility also improved.</p><p>The use of rating scales for motor function was mentioned in only three cases. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor score was recorded before and after only for Adrissi et al's second patient (27/31 out of a total of 124; their first case had an initial score of 49 with no follow-up score), while Petit et al's patient's UHDRS score decreased from 47 to 37 after 12 treatments and then rose to 57 after 1 year.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> For most cases, there was no mention of any response, which is not surprising because this was the focus of the treatment in only one of the studies.

However, in patients with pharmacological treatment resistance and the requirement for many drugs to manage symptoms, there does appear to be scope for significant rationalisation of pharmacological therapy when ECT is used adjunctively. Beale et al's patient and Cusin et al's first and sixth patients all presented between 10.5 and 19 years after diagnosis but responded well to limited ECT treatments and were discharged on much less medication.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Only Adrissi et al's third patient, Ranen et al's second patient and ours required extended ECT.

Characteristics such as the nature of symptoms, length of time from diagnosis, length of time of psychiatric symptoms, age and sex did not appear to affect the number of ECT treatments. However, refractory catatonia complicating psychosis may have been a factor in extended treatment, with Ranen et al's second patient and Merida-Puga et al's patient<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> requiring 35 and 42 treatments, respectively.</p><p>The four patients who had ECT more than 10 years after diagnosis<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> (Ranen et al's sixth, Cusin et al's first, fifth and seventh patients) also showed excellent responses to ECT with between 8 and 13 treatments.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-8" sec-type="other"><title>Length of seizure in seconds</title><p><xref rid="tab05" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the seizure duration in the cases where it was recorded.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Only Beale et al mentioned a reduction in seizure time from 57&#x000a0;s at the beginning of treatment to 19&#x000a0;s by the end.

Only Adrissi et al's third patient was started on maximum charge dose of 100% (504 mC) due to refractory psychosis. This was later cut down to 50% (252 mC) owing to a bout of delerium that was subsequently felt to be due to medication. The presence of catatonia in Merida-Puga et al and Ranen et al's second patient may be considered a proxy for severity, but this was not the case for the other two catatonic patients (see above). Likewise, short treatment courses were reported in the earlier studies to be more likely to lead to relapse, but this was not borne out by later studies (see above). Getting the dose and the induced seizure length right appears to take more time in the out-patient setting, as may be expected. The three intense in-patient stays for our patient, Merida-Puga et al's patient and Adrissi et al's third patient (3 months in the latter two cases) allowed this to be achieved more rapidly, but the cumulative doses were all high.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Overall, there appear to be no overt factors that predict who is likely to respond quickly or otherwise, although most patients will not require extended treatment based on this review.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-10" sec-type="other"><title>Lead positioning</title><p>The predominant positions were RUL in 12 patients, one RUL unilateral and bilateral (unspecified), four bilateral (one bilateral frontotemporal, three bilateral) and two bitemporal (Supplementary Table 1).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The diagnosis of Huntington's disease is usually preceded by psychiatric symptoms in cases where family history is absent, sometimes by years.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, as we found in this review, patients are now likely to have an established diagnosis of Huntington's by the time they are considered for ECT. Although a CAG repeat number greater than 36 in the Huntington gene confirms the disease, an increased number of repeats is negatively correlated with age at presentation rather than severity of disease.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Psychiatric manifestations of Huntington's disease vary according to the stage of the disease; apathy, for example, is found in 50% of patients by stage four on the UHDRS. Also present are obsessive&#x02013;compulsive behaviour, irritability and aggression. Depression also increases over time, with only psychosis remaining consistent throughout at 11%.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The prevalence of depression is about 50%, compared with anxiety at 17&#x02013;61%, irritability at 35&#x02013;73%, obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorders at 7&#x02013;50% and psychosis at 3&#x02013;11%. The prevalence of hypersexuality is between 2.1 and 30% and is slightly lower in women, whereas the prevalence of hyposexuality is higher at 63% in men and 75% in women.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The use of ECT, however, is recommended only for depression on the basis of two of the above series.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>There appeared to be little in the way of any effect on cognition with the use of ECT, although this was not a primary concern in this patient group. In the few reports where cognition was mentioned, the patients responded well and appeared to retain comparable pre-treatment scores over time, although the numbers were too small for us to draw any firm conclusions. However, Nakano et al's patient, despite comparable pre- and post-treatment MMSE scores (and significantly improved PANSS and BPRS scores), had greatly decreased 99 mTc uptake in the basal ganglia, cingulate gyrus and thalamus on SPECT after 21 ECT treatments compared to pre-treatment SPECT.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>There is little consistent evidence regarding the use of ECT for the motor manifestations of the disease. Chorea, a hyperkinetic movement disorder, shows variable response. In the studies considered in this review, chorea often responded to ECT (including for our patient), but this finding was not always documented and thus it cannot be extrapolated to a recommendation given the small number of patients. However, psychomotor retardation and catatonia, which are manifestations of psychiatric disease, all responded favourably, although the presence of catatonia may require more protracted ECT treatment. The reported swallowing issues and weight loss in our patient and others responded well. A situation that appeared terminal in our case has been managed effectively for the patient and her family with good control, for over 2 years following the first dose of ECT.</p><p>All the studies considered in the current review were either single-case reports or retrospective case series. There were no comparison or prospective studies. The most striking aspect of this literature was how the choice of ECT as a treatment came to be prescribed. In nearly all cases, ECT was a last resort when all else had failed, with the exception of one case in which it was used for the specific management of chorea.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Consequently, strict psychiatric criteria were lacking prior to the decision to start ECT. The main concern in using ECT was related to controlling the manifestations of psychosis or depression/suicidality, with concerns regarding other manifestations, such as outward aggression, in only a few cases. Clinical success was documented by a general clinical sense of improvement, serving as an indication of efficacy, with no clearly defined end points. Similarly, the cognitive and motor scoring of patients was haphazard and inconsistent, with only limited numbers of patients having clear objective scoring on any scales &#x02013; motor, cognitive or psychiatric performance &#x02013; either before or after ECT was administered in order to monitor patient responses.</p><p>It is clear that the preliminary though limited evidence from this review supports the use of ECT for relieving depressive symptoms. However, this is often considered as a last resort when all other interventions have failed. The current review suggests that additional consideration be given to the use of ECT as an adjunct in conventional treatment-resistant cases of depression, as well as for wider psychiatric manifestations of the disease, especially where depressive and psychotic symptoms coexist. These wider psychiatric manifestations and complications, which include psychomotor retardation and hallucinations, appear to respond well to the use of ECT. Where there are wider psychiatric manifestations of Huntington's disease, ECT may not only control these more effectively but could also lead to rationalisation of polypharmacy. Chorea may be less likely to respond to ECT, and so its use for this cannot be recommended based on the current review. Further investigative work with clear criteria and monitoring may lead to ECT being considered earlier and more often for patients with difficult-to-manage psychiatric manifestations of Huntington's disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec5"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Walied Mowafi</bold> is a Consultant Neurologist at the Department of Neurology, Calderdale Royal Hospital, West Yorkshire, UK. <bold>Jon Millard</bold> is a Consultant Psychiatrist at South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Wakefield, UK.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec6"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2056469420000510sup"><p>For supplementary material accompanying this paper visit http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.51.</p><media xlink:href="S2056469420000510sup.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" orientation="portrait" id="d39e1730" position="anchor"><caption><p>click here to view supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><notes id="nts2" notes-type="other"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>None.</p><p>ICMJE forms are in the supplementary material, available online at <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.51">https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.51</uri>.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cite1"><string-name><surname>Ranen</surname>
