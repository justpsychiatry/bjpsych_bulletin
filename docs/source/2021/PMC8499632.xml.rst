:Abstract:
   There is scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is
   real and that it provides an existential threat to humanity and the
   planet. In this article, we focus on climate change conspiracy
   theories and the impact of such beliefs on mental health. We discuss
   the psychiatric disorders that might be relevant to conspiracy belief
   endorsement and we present the underlying psychological mechanisms.
   We note that there is little to no literature to associate beliefs
   about climate change with serious mental health conditions. However,
   we anticipate that such beliefs may manifest pathologically in
   psychiatric presentations as climate change becomes increasingly at
   the forefront of the global agenda.

There is a consensus among climate scientists that anthropogenic climate
change is real, harmful to the environment and a threat to our
futures.\ :sup:`1` Despite this, climate change denial and scepticism
are prominent in social and political discourse, with support from
influential public figures.\ :sup:`2` Conspiracy theories are bedfellows
of climate denialism and scepticism and have been defined as ‘attempts
to explain the ultimate causes of significant social and political
events and circumstances with claims of secret plots by two or more
powerful actors’.\ :sup:`3` Climate change conspiracy theories are
popular, with endorsement between 20%\ :sup:`4` and 40%\ :sup:`5` in the
USA. In other Western countries, denial is less prevalent, though still
present.\ :sup:`6`

Douglas & Sutton\ :sup:`2` noted climate change conspiracy theories to
follow four main themes: scientists are faking climate change (a) for
political reasons or (b) to secure research funding, or climate change
is a hoax to (c) enable the ‘green agenda’ and (d) promote nuclear
power. Notably, each theme implicates ‘scientists’ in perverse and
deceptive actions. It would appear that this is required to undermine
the consensus position among experts.

.. _sec1:

Why do people believe climate change conspiracy theories?
=========================================================

Douglas et al\ :sup:`7` suggested that epistemic, existential and social
motivations underpin conspiracy beliefs. Epistemic motivations relate to
the extent to which individuals or groups hold knowledge of phenomena
that affect their lives. Conspiracy beliefs are strengthened when events
are significant and/or wide-reaching\ :sup:`8` and mainstream
explanations are simplistic or lacking emotional charge.\ :sup:`9`
Conspiracy beliefs can provide a sense of understanding in the face of
contradiction and uncertainty, and may offer closure when mainstream
narratives do not provide satisfactory explanations.\ :sup:`10`
Existential motivations relate to the experience of anxiety, threat or a
perception of powerlessness in the face of danger. In such instances,
conspiracy theories may provide safety.\ :sup:`11,12` Finally, social
motivations concern issues of power and hierarchy, with conspiracy
theories more likely to emerge in those who have experienced oppression,
victimisation or persecution.\ :sup:`13` In such circumstances, groups
can become insular and develop an ‘us versus them’ narrative.\ :sup:`14`
Safety is achieved through a narcissistic defence, whereby power is
transferred from perceived ‘elites’ to the conspiracy belief
holders.\ :sup:`15` Of note, such groups are predominantly single and
isolated ethnic-minority males with lower socioeconomic status and
educational achievement.\ :sup:`16`

Holding one conspiracy belief increases the likelihood of believing
another\ :sup:`17` and individuals predisposed to general conspiracy
thinking are more likely to deny climate change.\ :sup:`18` An
underlying tendency to prioritise counter-narrative explanations and to
distrust institutions may be apparent. The notion of political
socialisation is important (e.g.\ :sup:`13`); climate change denial is
part of the conservative rhetoric and conspiracy talk that is common
among world leaders such as Trump\ :sup:`19` and Bolsonaro.\ :sup:`20`
Political polarisation of climate attitudes has been well-evidenced in
the USA\ :sup:`21` and Europe,\ :sup:`6` among other regions. Climate
change conspiracy theories might suggest allegiance to a particular
conservative world view and be phenomenologically different from more
emotionally charged beliefs such as the QAnon and COVID-19 conspiracy
theories.

Conspiracy theories, overvalued beliefs and delusions: challenges with definitions
==================================================================================

Psychiatrists work with symptoms and diagnoses that are based on
criteria set out by manuals such as DSM-5 and ICD-10. When criteria are
met, a diagnosis can be made and a treatment plan devised. When thinking
about conspiracy theories, the psychiatric terms ‘overvalued ideas’ and
‘delusions’ are challenged. Psychiatry defines ‘overvalued ideas’ as an
erroneous response to an idea –‘an acceptable, comprehensible idea
pursued by the patient beyond the bounds of reason. It is usually
associated with abnormal personality’.\ :sup:`22` The overvalued idea
may be based on true evidence. The term was coined by Wernicke in 1906
and has further been explored by Jaspers and Fish, who made various
suggestions of how to distinguish overvalued ideas from
delusions.\ :sup:`23` A delusion is defined as a ‘false, unshakeable
idea or belief that is out of keeping with the patient's background; it
is held with extraordinary conviction and subjective
certainty’.\ :sup:`22` Consequently, there can be a diagnostic dilemma
as to which category climate change conspiracies – or any conspiracy
theory beliefs – best align.

.. _sec3:

The evidence supporting climate change conspiracy theories
==========================================================

Conspiracy theory beliefs are widespread (e.g.\ :sup:`24,25,26`). The
internet is rife with ‘fake news’ and ‘misinformation’. Social media
platforms, blogs and a whole range of other websites are dedicated to
the mass propagation of ‘evidence-base-less’ theories that directly
refute scientific findings.\ :sup:`27,28` Bye Bye Blue Sky is one of
many groups that promote and raise awareness of climate change
conspiracy theories. For example, their mission statement describes
‘chemtrails’ and a government conspiracy to control the weather as ‘the
toxic spraying of nano particulate metals which are further amplified by
ionospheric heaters to steer, direct and control our weather for
military purposes … we seek to apply the wealth of our knowledge,
passion and talents to end the illegal spraying of our planet’
(`byebyebluesky.com/ <https://byebyebluesky.com/>`__). Alarmingly, the
internet content and group demonstrations can be very convincing.
Furthermore, some theorists have mastered the ability to navigate
through such forums and use them to their advantage to disseminate their
views to a large population.\ :sup:`29`

An interesting quality of conspiracy theories is that the
counter-evidence is shunned by theorists who claim that the refutation
of their ideas by powerful figures is further evidence of truth
suppression. This introduces an ‘us versus them’ dynamic.\ :sup:`14` It
may also have a directly proportionate effect – the stronger the
evidence against the conspiracy theory, the more vehemently the
counter-narrative is held.\ :sup:`30` This is further reinforced by
computer algorithms that provide a feed of confirmatory evidence and
omit counter-narratives from view.\ :sup:`31` Curiously, it is evident
that the scientific community's message on climate change does not have
the same footing or far-reaching sustenance as the competing conspiracy
theories.

Referring back to the traditional definitions of overvalued ideas and
delusions, it seems that conspiracy theories about climate change could
be categorised as either or neither. A diagnostic challenge is
introduced when groups or ‘masses’ of believers share the same
conspiracy theory and it almost has the constructs of a culture.
Studies\ :sup:`4,5` have found the existence of large populations that
believe conspiracy theories, supporting the idea that such beliefs
extend beyond the individual. This directly causes conflict with the
definition of delusions. It emphasises the need for clinicians to
consider the presence of additional psychopathology and/or functional
impairment in order to make a diagnosis in an individual who is
preoccupied with conspiracy beliefs. It could be postulated that this
may divide psychiatrists. Some may consider that this group hold
pathological beliefs, whereas others may frame the beliefs as in keeping
with a ‘subculture’ and therefore not indicative of psychopathology.

Climate change conspiracies and mental disorders
================================================

Although there is an abundance of literature on climate change
conspiracy theories in terms of their nature and spread, there appears
to be very little on how such theories have had a clinical effect on
mental health. In this section, the link between climate change
conspiracy theories and mental disorders is discussed.

.. _sec4-1:

Personality disorders
---------------------

Individuals with certain personality disorder diagnoses are likely to be
more susceptible to preferring narratives engineered by conspiracy
beliefs due to the nature of the definition in diagnostic manuals such
as ICD-10. In particular, the cluster A personality disorders have the
fitting profile. The description of paranoid personality disorder
specifically makes reference to a ‘preoccupation with unsubstantiated
conspiratorial explanations of events both immediate to the patient and
in the world at large’. Additional traits include recurrent suspicions
without justification, general suspiciousness and a pervasive tendency
to distort experience by misinterpreting neutral actions of others as
hostile or malicious. Persons with a diagnosis of paranoid personality
disorder may also have a rather rigid world view and an assertive sense
of personal rights, which may not be proportionate to actual
situations.\ :sup:`32` It is apparent how this profile might cross over
with characteristics identified in those who endorse conspiracy theories
(e.g.\ :sup:`7`).

The ideas characteristic of paranoid personality disorder are typically
persecutory and self-referential. Individuals diagnosed with this
disorder are likely to be socially withdrawn and perceive that they are
unduly victimised.\ :sup:`33` Imhoff & Lamberty\ :sup:`34` noted similar
characteristics in relation to subclinical paranoia. However, instant
access to widespread networks, facilitated by the internet, allows the
formation of clusters of like-minded individuals who also hold similar
persecutory, self-referential ideas. There is now a mechanism by which
such individuals can indulge pathologically in misinformation to bolster
their false beliefs together and ‘connect’. Therefore, in this scenario,
self-referential ideas become a collective experience.\ :sup:`35` This
could further add opposition to the mainstream narrative and have an
impact on individual presentation.

The criteria for schizoid personality disorder include traits such as an
‘invariable preference for solitary activities’, ‘a lack of close
friends or confiding relationships’, ‘poor acknowledgement of social
norms and conventions’ and, importantly, ‘excessive preoccupation with
fantasy and introspection’.\ :sup:`32` A combination of such traits
could underpin a tendency to believe conspiracy theories.

Schizotypy is also implicated in the conspiracy theory
literature.\ :sup:`36` Schizotypy is captured in DSM-5 as a personality
disorder and categorised with schizophrenia in ICD-10. March &
Springer\ :sup:`37` explored whether the ‘odd beliefs’ and ‘magical
thinking’ seen in schizotypy predicted belief in conspiracy theories and
found a significant association between the two. The authors commented
that the results indicated that individuals with ‘unusual patterns of
thinking and cognitions’ and ‘interpersonal and affective’ deficits were
more likely to hold conspiracy beliefs. There are indications that
particular personality traits are risk factors for psychosis in an
attenuated form.\ :sup:`38,39`

.. _sec4-2:

Nihilistic and apocalyptic delusions in psychotic depression
------------------------------------------------------------

Severe depressive disorders may have a psychotic component in which
mood-congruent delusions are a feature. Nihilistic delusions, where the
patient has abnormal conviction that they are dead, their organs are
rotting or the world is dead around them, are not uncommon.\ :sup:`40`
There is a possibility that this belief could extend to an individual
believing that they are personally responsible for climate change or –
in extreme cases – the destruction of the world.

Another type of delusion referred to in the literature is ‘apocalyptic
delusions’ or ‘end-of-the-world delusions’. The content of such
delusions is thought to be influenced by contemporary culture and
societal changes. Early content of such delusions included fears of the
plague, famine and asteroids hitting the earth.\ :sup:`41` Although
these persist, the content has evolved in the present day, as would be
expected, and includes despair over climate change. ‘Climate apocalypse’
and ‘climate dystopia’ְ are terms that encompass the idea that an
apocalypse will occur as a result of climate change – severe weather
changes, forest fires and a depletion of natural resources will render
the earth uninhabitable and therefore bring about the inevitable
impossibility of the survival of human life.\ :sup:`42`

There is a single published case study to describe this phenomenon. Wolf
& Salo\ :sup:`43` described a 17-year-old boy diagnosed with a
depressive disorder, who developed a delusion that his consumption of
water would lead to the deaths of millions of people, as water supplies
would be depleted. This was associated with ‘visions’ of an apocalypse.

Overall, there is a lack of recorded clinical cases of severe depression
related to climate change or climate change conspiracy theories.
However, with heightened attention on and uncertainty about climate
change in modern society, there may be an increase in manifestations of
this in depressive disorders through the modes suggested.

.. _sec4-3:

Psychotic disorders
-------------------

There are controversial terms such as ‘mass delusion’, ‘climate
alarmists’ and ‘greenhouse sceptics’, which refer to various groups of
people who hold certain beliefs about climate change.\ :sup:`44` There
are conspiracy beliefs propagated by some ‘climate deniers’ to state
that climate change is a hoax.\ :sup:`45` Counter-conspiracy beliefs
also exist, which propose that the impact of climate change is
understated, data are suppressed and governments are purposefully
minimising the accelerating impact on the earth to fit with their
political agendas.\ :sup:`2` In terms of psychiatric diagnosis there is
no evidence to suggest that such beliefs have a delusional quality. The
terms ‘mass delusion’ and ‘climate deniers’ do not have clinical
connotations. Nonetheless, there is likely to be a minority with
associated risk factors for psychiatric disorders within the groups who
are prone to holding these beliefs with absolute conviction despite
contrary scientific evidence. Such delusions may be considered part of
an evolving clinical picture of a delusional disorder, or a psychotic
disorder such as schizophrenia. Considering the nature of these
disorders, if climate change delusions were present, they would be
expected to have a bizarre quality; and it would not be unusual for
extreme conspiracy theories to be the themes.

There is a small literature base – and accompanying anecdotal evidence –
concerning the interplay between sociocultural events and delusional
content. For example, Cannon & Kramer\ :sup:`46` have noted that
delusional content in the USA related to syphilis in the early 20th
century, Nazis during Second World War, communists during the Cold War
and technology in more recent years. The internet has become
increasingly relevant to delusional content (e.g.\ :sup:`47,48,49`).
Curious case studies also exist. For example, Caseiro &
Queiros\ :sup:`50` reported a case in which football was thematic, in
the context of Portugal winning Euro 2016. Notably, psychosis is often
triggered by real-world events and the nature of delusional content can
reflect genuine concerns about the world, anxiety and existential
threat.\ :sup:`51`

It is possible that concerns about climate change could exacerbate
existing delusional beliefs, or extreme views could escalate above a
delusional threshold. Consequently, such beliefs could become
‘diagnosable’ and meet criteria for a psychotic disorder.

.. _sec5:

A psychological adjunct
=======================

There is an association between the cognitive and affective processes
that underpin conspiracy beliefs and those evidenced in delusional
thinking. For example, the jumping-to-conclusions bias has been observed
in psychotic-like thinking.\ :sup:`52` This bias is associated with the
overly rapid appraisal of stimuli to form a conclusion and has recently
been evidenced in a sample of conspiracy theory believers.\ :sup:`53`
Poorer analytical thinking is also implicated,\ :sup:`54` and cognitive
distortions noted in depression could also be relevant.\ :sup:`35`
Similarly, historical victimisation and a schematic view of the world as
dangerous are risk factors for psychosis\ :sup:`55` and can provide a
framework through which anomalous information is perceived. Individuals
with schizotypal and paranoid personality disorder diagnoses are also
likely to have experienced danger in their early lives\ :sup:`56,57` and
such threatening experiences are also precipitants to conspiracy
beliefs.\ :sup:`11,13` Distortions in human information processing are
commonplace, adaptive and dimensional, with evidence to suggest that
some individuals perceive ‘true’ information, whereas others omit, deny
or delude as their environmental niche requires.\ :sup:`58` Events that
elicit threat responses are particularly relevant. Additionally, the
demographic profiles of those who endorse conspiracies\ :sup:`16` are
similar to those found within psychosis cohorts.\ :sup:`59`

Many theorists and clinicians support the concept of dimensional
psychosis with phenomenological continuity.\ :sup:`60,61` Subclinical
delusional thinking has been associated with conspiracy
beliefs,\ :sup:`62` as has paranoia.\ :sup:`34,63` Conspiracy theorists
may not be delusional or paranoid. However, it is plausible that they
exhibit similar genetic, psychological and/or social characteristics to
those who are vulnerable to psychosis. The
proneness–persistence–impairment model\ :sup:`61` and extended psychosis
phenotype\ :sup:`64` are helpful frameworks for exploring the
relationship. For many, a belief in climate change conspiracies could
simply concern loyalty to conservative values.\ :sup:`13` However, some
may have an underlying predisposition to psychosis, with a tendency
towards conspiracy thinking. Potential migration towards clinical
thresholds could occur in response to greater perceived threat from
significant events and exposure to, and preoccupation with,
conspiracies. Individuals with diagnoses of paranoid or schizotypal
personality disorder may fall into this position. The notion of the
extended phenotype could explain why individuals who hold one conspiracy
belief are more prone to believing others (e.g.\ :sup:`17`); this has
also been called ‘conspiracist ideation’.\ :sup:`65,66`

.. _sec6:

Forecast
========

There is evidence to suggest that historical events have informed
delusional content\ :sup:`46,49` and there are some indications that the
COVID-19 pandemic has had a recent effect.\ :sup:`67` Delusions can be
triggered by real-world events and the content can reflect genuine
concerns about the world, anxiety and existential threat.\ :sup:`51`
Notably, the conditions in respect to the above phenomena were opportune
for the development of conspiracy theories. That is, these events
generated real threat to individuals and communities (e.g.\ :sup:`7`).

It can be hypothesised that the global reluctance/opposition to
impactful climate policy change is actually protective with regard to
the pervasive development of conspiracy belief psychopathology. That is,
conspiracy theories emerge when a way of life is threatened. At present,
climate policy has not had a tangible impact on freedoms, rights or
lifestyle. Nonetheless, we forecast that this will likely change in the
coming decades (e.g. as governments fall in line with the Paris
Agreement). To our knowledge, there is only a single case
study\ :sup:`43` to describe the interplay between climate change
conspiracy beliefs and severe psychopathology. It is hypothesised that
climate change has not yet become a common feature of delusional
beliefs.

For those who have a predisposition to psychopathology, such changes may
trigger migration towards clinical disorder. It is possible that climate
change and associated conspiracy beliefs may affect mental health in the
following ways: (a) dramatic societal changes (e.g. energy conservation
policies, restrictions on existing freedoms) might precipitate an
increase in climate change conspiracy theories, and individuals
predisposed to conspiracy thinking (including those with underlying
paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal traits) might migrate to delusion;
(b) the increasing presence of climate change discourse in public
conversations could lead to such content appearing in the content of
pre-existing delusional belief systems; and (c) concerns and guilt about
climate change could lead to presentations of depressive psychosis with
nihilistic and/or climate-related apocalyptic delusions.

.. _sec7:

Concluding remarks
==================

As climate change becomes more present in public consciousness,
conspiracy theories are likely to become increasingly prominent and to
manifest in the presentation of several mental disorders. This article
has hypothesised that there may be a potential commonality between
pervasive conspiracy thinking and mental disorders, particularly
psychosis and certain personality disorders. However, it is proposed
that clinicians approach individuals who hold conspiracy beliefs with
diagnostic caution, given that conspiracy beliefs are widely held within
the general population. Careful assessment is needed to identify those
who are psychologically vulnerable to developing mental health
complications due to exposure to conspiracy beliefs.

Further research is recommended to investigate whether a proportion of
climate change conspiracy theory advocates do have underlying
psychological risk factors for the development of concerning
psychopathology; and also how such theories have featured in mental
disorders, particularly as symptoms of psychosis or personality
disorder.
