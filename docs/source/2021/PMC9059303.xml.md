title: More research needed into long-term medical student mental health
  during COVID-19 pandemic and beyond
---

pmc

The mental health of healthcare professionals has been significantly
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.^1^ We believe that more research
focusing specifically on the long-term mental health of medical students
is required. Medical students are an at-risk group, with a greater
incidence of anxiety^2^ than the general population, and a higher
prevalence of suicidal ideation than physicians and nurses.^3^ The risk
is further compounded by being young,^1^ having higher awareness of
disease severity, and possessing common personality traits such as
maladaptive perfectionism and difficulty adapting to disruption in
routine.^2^

Medical students often face a sense of duty to volunteer in hospitals in
times of global health emergencies such as the current pandemic, which
can bring particular emotional challenges. The subsequent higher risk of
transmitting COVID-19 may cause increased social isolation. Uncertainty
around medical education due to cancelled exams and placements also
increases stress.^4^

Although a recent meta-analysis showed no difference in anxiety during
COVID-19 in medical students,^2^ isolated studies worldwide have shown
increased anxiety in those whose loved ones had contracted COVID-19 and
who had interacted with COVID-19 patients.^4^

Higher levels of baseline stress and depression are negative predictors
of poor mental health,^1^ so more research must be done to identify
those especially at risk. Those with pre-existing mental health issues
have reported decreased access to the usual support services during the
pandemic.^1^ To our knowledge, there is no available literature
exploring the impact of COVID-19 on medical students with pre-existing
mental illness. Experiences in previous pandemics such as SARS show that
long-term mental health issues such as alcohol misuse and post-traumatic
stress symptoms can persist for several years in healthcare workers who
have been quarantined or have worked in high-risk areas.^5^

The majority of current studies of mental health in COVID-19 have been
cross-sectional, and few have focused on medical students. Longitudinal,
large-scale, multi-country studies focusing on medical students of all
age groups and investigating more variables, such as pre-existing mental
illness, are required to identify those most at risk and the long-term
effects on this population. The results of these studies could be used
to improve future implementation of targeted medical student-specific
mental healthcare interventions.^1^
