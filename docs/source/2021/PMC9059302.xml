At the time of the study, approximately 30% of all patients were prescribed clozapine, with an average age of 36 years. This project was nested within a larger service evaluation of clozapine monitoring at the unit, which resulted in a clozapine clinic being recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-2"><title>Data collection</title><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-2-1"><title>Staff</title><p>Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 17 staff members. Purposive sampling was conducted in order to represent the different staff groups involved in clozapine monitoring.</p><p>First, all junior doctors based at the unit were invited by S.B. to participate in a focus group; all five agreed to participate. The physical health team, encompassing two general nurses and two healthcare support workers, also agreed to participate in a focus group. With regard to mental health ward staff, S.B. attended a selection of in-patient wards and opportunistically asked mental health staff (nurses and support workers) to take part in semi-structured interviews, which were conducted in a private room at the time of recruitment. Eight interviews were conducted. Interviews instead of focus groups were used for ward staff owing to the practical difficulties of multiple staff being simultaneously removed from clinical duties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-2-2"><title>Patients</title><p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six patients. Again, purposive recruitment was performed to recruit patients from medium-secure, low-secure and step-down wards. Patients were approached by a mental health nurse, who introduced the project to the patients and accompanied S.B. during interviews. Only those patients that ward staff deemed clinically stable and able to provide informed consent were approached.</p><p>In all cases, the project's purpose and voluntary nature were explained, and verbal consent was obtained. As the primary purpose of the project was service evaluation, written consent was not deemed to be required when planning data collection with senior colleagues at the unit. Verbal consent was witnessed and formally recorded. It was required that participants spoke English and could provide verbal consent. Topic guides were used for interviews and focus groups and encompassed clozapine monitoring in general, with a possible clinic discussed at the end (see Appendices 1 and 2). The length of interviews ranged from 5 to 20 min, and focus groups lasted approximately 30&#x000a0;min.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-3"><title>Epistemology</title><p>The research was underpinned by an interpretivist approach, which recognises the subjective nature of knowledge and the need to understand situations from the perspective of those involved.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-4"><title>Analysis</title><p>The focus group with doctors was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. All other data collection took place in clinical areas where it was not permitted to use audio-recording devices. Therefore, extensive field notes were made, and several quotes from each interviewee were transcribed verbatim to ensure data capture. Subsequently, based on field notes, quotes and transcripts, thematic analysis was utilised in the format described by Braun and Clarke.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thematic analysis is based on finding and interpreting patterns (themes) within the data.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Following data familiarisation and immersion, a list of codes was generated by S.B. Next, themes were searched for, and an analytical framework was constructed by S.B. Where this framework did not fit the data, themes were further refined and alternative explanations sought until a final framework was agreed by S.B., J.B. and M.L. As well as following standardised topic guides, robust and transparent analysis was critical to ensuring reflexivity and minimising the researcher's influence on emerging themes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-5"><title>Ethics</title><p>Formal ethical approval was not required as the project formed part of a clinical service evaluation.

No staff group saw themselves as responsible for cardiometabolic monitoring and were not able to identify who was. The main barrier to defining responsibilities was that clozapine monitoring spans mental and physical health. As an antipsychotic, the physical health team saw clozapine as a psychiatric responsibility. By contrast, ward staff believed that it was outside the scope of psychiatry, owing to the physical health monitoring and extensive side-effects.

Staff understood the risks of not effectively monitoring clozapine and were keen to implement a more efficient model. This mirrors the findings of a previous evaluation of community shared-care clozapine monitoring, where forensic healthcare professionals were motivated by enabling patients to develop skills for independence.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Both staff and patients believed that physical and mental healthcare were equally important for people taking clozapine.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In our study, there was a range of understanding among patients, with stepdown patients having greater understanding of the associated benefits of monitoring. Their engagement is a further key facilitator to be harnessed. Linked to this, staff noted that patients responded favourably to routine, and that consistency should be a core component of clozapine monitoring.</p><p>In terms of barriers, an important finding was that roles and responsibilities for monitoring were not clearly defined and inter-team communication was sometimes lacking. Spanning mental and physical health, clozapine monitoring was widely perceived to be outside the scope of practice of the different teams involved. These factors have previously been identified as key determinants of psychiatrists&#x02019; practice in relation to clozapine, and major contributors to low rates and inconsistency of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Likewise, there was sometimes a lack of knowledge about clozapine monitoring, particularly aspects that staff did not perceive as their responsibility. Although the FBC component was widely understood, as results must be available to enable clozapine dispensing, some staff perceived understanding of cardiometabolic monitoring to be limited among ward staff, despite the widespread prevalence of these complications. Defined roles and responsibilities must be supported by robust pathways for clozapine monitoring. Inconsistent documentation, limited knowledge about clozapine and a lack of communication between teams have previously been shown to limit improvements when abnormalities are detected.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Logistically, access to phlebotomy-trained staff was a key barrier to on-schedule monitoring, which has been highlighted in previous audits of clozapine monitoring.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> From a patient perspective, monitoring was passive, and many had little insight into the monitoring requirements. Although there were more barriers than facilitators with respect to changing the clozapine monitoring system, the facilitators were strong motivators, so it is anticipated that they will drive the proposed change and allow the barriers identified to be overcome.</p><p>Although not widely explored in the academic literature, there is some consensus as to what gold-standard clozapine monitoring encompasses, and this study adds to this. First, it is essential that staff and patients perceive clozapine monitoring as a tool for facilitating patient recovery, independence and safety, and not simply as the process for supplying a medication.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Patient education should not be a one-off event but should be repeated throughout treatment, especially as patients may be unwell at the time of clozapine initiation and have low health literacy.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Clozapine monitoring must be supported by care pathways and effective interventions to ensure that, first, monitoring takes place and, second, that abnormal findings are actioned.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Pathways should be standardised so that they can be easily followed by busy staff working across wards. Any system of monitoring must be supported by electronic tools to keep track of monitoring.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> An in-patient clozapine clinic is an effective system for clozapine monitoring that is widely supported by staff and patients. This provides FBC monitoring, along with monitoring of other physical health parameters and side-effects. In terms of staffing, multidisciplinary representation is likely to be effective, with mental and physical health co-staffing supported in this study. Several senior staff members in our study raised concerns about undergraduate training around clozapine. Given the complex monitoring and severe side-effects, robust training on clozapine should be encompassed by undergraduate mental health nursing degrees and a mandatory workplace training module. Where establishment of a clozapine clinic is not feasible, it is recommended that, as a minimum, a clozapine pathway is established that defines the roles and responsibilities of different staff groups and triggers appropriate communication and actions where abnormal results are identified. This should be underpinned by an electronic system that simplifies the process and is accessible by the relevant staff.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>As with much qualitative work, there were small numbers of participants, and they were interviewed in a single location. This restricts the transferability of results, as some may be specific to the individual setting. However, the findings reinforce those from the wider literature, and beliefs and challenges have been identified that are widely applicable to mental health settings.</p><p>A further limitation is the possibility that the results were influenced by recall and social desirability bias. Furthermore, as patients were approached by a senior nurse, it is possible that patients with a favourable attitude towards clozapine or a good relationship with staff were recruited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Summary</title><p>Clozapine is widely used in forensic settings, yet considerable challenges remain around its use, particularly ensuring on-schedule monitoring of physical health parameters. The reasons underlying this have not previously been widely explored, and this qualitative study adds to the evidence base by identifying facilitators of and barriers to monitoring. Forensic healthcare staff are highly motivated to promote skills for independence and recovery among patients, and understand the role of clozapine care in this. This motivation and enthusiasm is a core facilitator of positive change and increases the likelihood that change will be sustained. Formal procedures and pathways must be in place to underlie clozapine monitoring, supported by electronic systems and tools. A clozapine clinic is a robust mechanism for providing in-patient clozapine monitoring in secure settings that is widely supported by staff and patients, and prepares patients for transition to the community. These findings can be applied to other mental health units to optimise their systems of clozapine monitoring.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all of the staff who facilitated this project.
