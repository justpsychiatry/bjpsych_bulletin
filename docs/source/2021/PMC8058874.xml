Reports indicating the damage to health caused by poverty-inequality in Britain go back at least as far as Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree's study of York around 1900, Julian Tudor Hart's &#x02018;inverse care law&#x02019; in 1971, and the government-commissioned and suppressed Black Report of 1980.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The narrative of governments abandoning some of the most deprived and vulnerable people in society is ongoing.</p><p>As Byrne and James point out, people with severe mental illness today have an additional layer of disadvantage, a &#x02018;lower status conferred on them&#x02019;, a state of &#x02018;subcitizenship&#x02019;, due to stigma and marginalisation, associated with societal and government disinclination to resource care for them. This too is long term. In 1908, psychiatrist William Stoddart<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> accused the asylum leadership (which had statutory responsibility for the care of mentally unwell people) of having &#x02018;excessively economical tendencies&#x02019;, neglecting their patients, the subcitizens of their time. This neglect was associated with adverse outcomes, such as excess morbidity and mortality from physical illness: in asylums, the death rate from tuberculosis, a poverty-related potentially preventable disease, was ten times higher than in the community. Then, as now, it was convenient for the authorities to attribute high rates of physical illness to a person's underlying mental disorder, rather than providing resources to allow services to support those patients adequately, whether in the asylums of the past or in the community today.</p><p>Government bodies have repeatedly sought the cheapest short-term measures for managing mental disorders, overlooking social and environmental root causes of the problems and failing to consider longer-term health and social benefits of adequate resourcing. Sometimes these principles extend to public health more generally. Perhaps the most outstanding recent demonstration of a quick-and-cheap government fix was the advice at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for everyone to take vitamin D, based on the finding of high mortality from COVID-19 in Black and minority ethnic groups, who are particularly likely to have low levels. If vitamin D has any effect, it appears to be non-specific.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In other words, the quick-and-cheap fix did not work. Rather, COVID-19 deaths, as Byrne and James remind us, are associated with social deprivation, which may also be associated with low vitamin D. Vitamin D won't fix the real problems.</p></body><back><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cite1"><string-name><surname>Byrne</surname>
