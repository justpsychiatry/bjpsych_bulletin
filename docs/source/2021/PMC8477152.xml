The letters of complaint raised several similar issues, which were presented to the author for response. At our request, the author has addressed some omissions in the original article, particularly in relation to a declaration of interest of which we had been unaware. Also, some clarifications and additional references have been added to support a number of statements. An updated article is being published and we are publishing this corrigendum outlining the changes made &#x02013; the original article remains available, as supplementary material to the updated article.
