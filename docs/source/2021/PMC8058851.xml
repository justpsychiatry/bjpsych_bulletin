Indeed, earlier studies have shown that gathering information and access to means of suicide are known indicators of high suicidal intent and risk.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Yet, previous literature has mostly focused on prevalence of methods, and associations with gender, age and mental disorder.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> How or why individuals consider, choose or discard particular methods are not well understood.</p><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that different methods, and combinations of methods, vary not only in relation to lethality, but also in the extent to which they predict subsequent suicidal behaviour and &#x02018;method switching&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Their wider impact can also vary, not least by virtue of the exposure and potential clustering/&#x02018;contagion' effects associated with more public, unusual and &#x02018;newsworthy&#x02019; methods.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Indeed, avoiding &#x02018;excessive detail of the method [&#x02026;] to prevent simulative acts&#x02019; remains to date the only official regulation for the reporting of suicide in the UK.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>This clearly points to the importance of better understanding the cultural and cognitive availability of different methods of suicide. Previous studies in this emerging field have identified these as key drivers in people's method choices, but have explored their significance in relation to a relatively narrow range of methods and with generally small study samples.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, earlier literature has tended to focus on fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour, overlooking its immediate, and generally less understood, precursor: suicidal ideation. Understanding the psychological processes preceding a suicide attempt is crucial for the potential to intervene, as is knowing what prevents the majority of individuals in distress from acting on thoughts of suicide, at a particular moment and/or over time.</p><p>The stability, or otherwise, of method choices also warrants further attention. A recent systematic review found that a third of individuals (33.3%) switch methods between successive episodes of self-harm, and almost half (42.11%) between an episode of self-harm and suicide.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Based on prevalence of methods, there appears to be no discernible or predictable pattern to such means switching.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Exploration of meanings, motivations and mechanisms may, however, offer valuable new insights. For example, a study in Austria showed that, despite method switching between episodes of self-harm being common, choice of means in the time immediately preceding a suicide attempt is often stable, and focused on a single method.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec1-2" sec-type="other"><title>Aims</title><p>The present study aimed to investigate, for the first time, first-person accounts of the factors deterring and prompting consideration and/or use of specific methods of suicide among people with a history of suicidal behaviour and those who have experienced, but not enacted, suicidal thoughts. Dominant models of suicidal behaviour point to this as an important distinction, with potential for novel insights into the transition from suicidal ideation to behaviour.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Given the disproportionate risk of suicide in men in the UK,<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> gender differences in method choices were also explored, in relation to both suicidal ideation and behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="other"><title>Online survey</title><p>Data were gathered as part of a wider study of method and location choices in relation to suicidal thoughts and attempts in the UK (QUEST, Qualitative Understanding of Experiencing Suicidal Thoughts<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>). A national online survey inviting people to share their experiences of suicidality was advertised through suicide prevention organisations such as Samaritans UK, online forums, social media and special interest groups. Study posters and leaflets were also placed on university bulletin boards, at local branch offices of relevant charities, in the National Suicide Prevention Alliance newsletter and were mailed out to supporters of the charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM).</p><p>The 16-item anonymous survey asked participants if they had ever experienced suicidal thoughts and, if applicable, to describe in an open-text format whether this involved a specific method or methods, and why. Those who reported prior suicidal behaviour were then asked the same question in relation to their suicide attempt/s. All questions were optional, and no word limit, prompting or structure were imposed on open-ended responses. This also meant that multiple methods and/or reasons for (or against) using different means of suicide could be provided. Further information was gathered about the specific location or locations of suicidal thoughts and behaviours; about suggestions for preventative measures at different locations; and sociodemographic details (see Supplementary Appendix available at <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.15">https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.15</uri> for a copy of the full survey).</p><p>Links to further information about the study and to support services for those experiencing suicidal thoughts were available both at the beginning and the end of the survey.

In other words, they can help us understand which methods are cognitively available to individuals in crisis (in a given sociocultural context), and what makes them more or less &#x02018;attractive&#x02019; to them.</p><p>In this study, self-poisoning was the most commonly contemplated method of suicide. However, most respondents had considered multiple methods of suicide, particularly those who had also engaged in suicidal behaviour. These included a fairly wide range of potential methods and, especially among individuals who had never attempted suicide, relatively uncommon means such as jumping or lying in front of a moving object, drowning, handgun discharge and crashing of a motor vehicle. In England and Wales, self-harm involving a moving object, drowning or fall and fracture accounts, all together, for 12% of all suicides,<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and only 1% of hospital presentations for self-harm.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Firearm use, although a common suicide method in countries with less stringent gun control such as the USA,<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> is even rarer in the UK, accounting for less than 2% of all suicides<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and 0.03% of self-harm hospital presentations.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although these are only a small proportion of completed suicides and hospital presentations for self-harm, such methods tend to be disproportionately reported in the media,<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> which may reflect and account for their over-representation and over-availability in people's suicidal thoughts (in the UK, most suicides are hanging<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> whereas most hospital presentations for self-harm involve self-poisoning<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>). Almost 10% of the participants explicitly identified exposure to a given method as a primary motivation for considering it as a means of suicide. Even more common reasons were perceived method ease, accessibility, speed and effectiveness, alongside the desire to minimise pain and violence.</p><p>However, the range of methods described in relation to actual suicidal behaviour was narrower, as were respondents&#x02019; motivations for using such methods. Over three quarters of respondents attempted suicide by self-poisoning, with many switching to this method having also considered more violent or unusual means. For almost half of the participants, choice of attempt method was primarily dictated by accessibility, and ease of method and the minimisation of pain were more common concerns than perceived speed or likelihood of death. An exception was jumping/lying in front of a vehicle, for which method effectiveness was the most frequently cited reason (see also Marzano et al<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>).</p><p>In relation to all methods, lethality appeared to be a greater concern for male than female respondents, and impulsivity less common, as also reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Together with the increased use of methods other than self-poisoning,<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> this might contribute to the disproportionate risk of suicide in men.</p><p>Of note are also some of the differences between respondents who had contemplated but never engaged in suicidal behaviour, and those who had previously attempted suicide. The former were more likely to mention wanting to minimise the impact on others, especially family and friends, and, in smaller numbers, to be in an isolated location where one's attempt and body would not be discovered. This points to the presence and impact on bystanders and loved ones as important &#x02018;dissuaders&#x02019; in relation to suicide. Indeed, these were also among the most frequent reasons for not attempting suicide by a specific method. Other common deterrents were fears of surviving with injuries and of &#x02018;not getting it right&#x02019;.</p><p>Interestingly, impulsivity was not a more common theme in those who had attempted suicide <italic>per se</italic>, but was cited more frequently in relation to suicidal behaviour than ideation. This finding lends support to the idea that individuals who attempt suicide may not have significantly elevated trait impulsiveness, compared with &#x02018;ideators&#x02019;; however, they may have higher impulsiveness when in a negative state.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="other"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>We analysed rich descriptions of people's choice of methods in relation to suicidal thoughts as well as behaviours, with strong interrater reliability, and no prompting, structure or limit to the answers that could be provided. This exploratory, inductive approach is rare with samples as large as the current study's, and allows for appropriately powered statistical analyses, as well as more nuanced, in-depth analyses of particular groups or methods, including the different images, myths and cultural scripts that exists around &#x02013; and against &#x02013; specific means of suicide (as presented elsewhere in relation to railway suicide<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>).</p><p>However, findings were based on a self-selected, predominantly female sample, and may not necessarily be representative of all individuals who consider, attempt or indeed die by suicide, within the UK and more widely. National and cultural variations in suicide method choices suggest the need for replication with broader and more diverse samples,<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> in a wider range of community and clinical settings.</p><p>Given the exploratory nature of this study, we did not gather systematic information about potentially important factors such as prior psychiatric and family history, nor about the sequence or temporality of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. This limits the conclusions that may be drawn in relation to method switching, escalation and substitution, and prevented us from making inferences about age differences in method choice. Further, longitudinal studies could usefully investigate how the frequency, intensity and intent of suicidal thoughts and behaviour may affect method choices in different groups and communities. A more structured approach to gathering information about deterring factors could also offer important insights into how best to prevent, and &#x02018;dissuade&#x02019; from, specific means of suicide, in different contexts and locations.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-3" sec-type="other"><title>Implications</title><p>Previous research has concluded that &#x02018;people's risks or needs [cannot be] based simply on the method of harm&#x02019;,<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> or the potential lethality of that method. The results of this study also suggest that the methods people consider when contemplating suicide are often not the ones that are then enacted in a suicide attempt, nor are they necessarily chosen for the same reasons. Nonetheless, exploring method choices is far from a fruitless activity, and can usefully inform preventative initiatives.</p><p>Consistent with earlier literature, our findings suggest that cognitive and physical availability are key drivers in the choice and prevalence of suicide methods. The former appears to be particularly relevant in the context of people's suicidal thoughts, with methods perceived to be &#x02018;easy&#x02019; and lethal featuring highly in individuals&#x02019; so called &#x02018;ideation menu&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The latter (i.e. the accessibility of a given method), becomes especially important in the context of a suicide attempt, and impulsivity relatively more common. This clearly underscores the need for preventative measures that restrict access to means and delay impulsive behaviour, such as the erection of barriers at high-risk locations and reduced pack sizes of paracetamol.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Avoiding depictions and descriptions of suicide methods in the media may help limit the cognitive availability of specific means, particularly for methods portrayed as lethal, easy, quick and painless. This may be especially important in the reporting of celebrity suicides. A recent meta-analysis found that when the suicide method used by a celebrity was reported, there was an associated 30% increase in deaths by the same method.<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>In clinical settings, exploring the decision-making around specific methods may help challenge unhelpful myths and misconceptions, identify areas of ambivalence and hope, and develop appropriate safety and treatment plans. At public-health level, factors known to attract individuals and subgroups to lethal means of suicide may be challenged via targeted communication and media strategies, and common &#x02018;dissuaders&#x02019; reinforced. However, the risk and unintended consequences of different approaches to means and &#x02018;myth-restriction&#x02019; need careful thought and evaluation, whether in the context of means-restriction counselling<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> or as part of wider public health approaches. Further research is needed in this area, but the risks and ethics of how and where research findings are disseminated and &#x02018;translated&#x02019; need careful attention to avoid reinforcing the acceptability and availability of (lethal) means of self-harm.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are greatly indebted to the hundreds of people who generously shared their time, stories and experiences with us.
