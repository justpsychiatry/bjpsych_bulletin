  **Aims and method** To systematically review the prevalence and
  associated factors of burnout and stress-related psychiatric disorders
  among UK doctors. An extensive search was conducted of PubMed,
  EBSCOhost and British medical journals for studies published over a
  20-year span measuring the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity (using
  the General Health Questionnaire) and burnout (using the Maslach
  Burnout Inventory).

  **Results** Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity ranged from 17 to 52%.
  Burnout scores for emotional exhaustion ranged from 31 to 54.3%,
  depersonalisation 17.4 to 44.5% and low personal accomplishment 6 to
  39.6%. General practitioners and consultants had the highest scores.
  Factors significantly associated with increase in the prevalence of
  burnout and psychiatric morbidity include low job satisfaction,
  overload, increased hours worked and neuroticism.

  **Clinical implications** The results indicate a worryingly high rate
  of burnout and psychiatric morbidity among UK doctors, which could
  have a huge negative impact on healthcare provision in general.
  Factors at personal and organisational levels contribute to burnout
  and psychiatric morbidity, and so efforts made to counter these
  problems should target both levels.

title: "Burnout and psychiatric morbidity among doctors in the UK: a
  systematic literature review of prevalence and associated factors"
---

Doctors have a legal duty broader than that of any other health
professional and therefore a responsibility to contribute to the
effective running of the organisation in which they work, and to its
future direction.^1^ In an environment where their health and well-being
is not prioritised doctors sometimes become ill, manifesting features of
burnout and/or stress-related psychiatric disorders. Such psychiatric
morbidity, or 'caseness', is detected using self-reported instruments
such as the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).^2^ Doctors also
experience 'burnout', which is defined as a syndrome of exhaustion,
cynicism and low professional efficacy.^3^ Maslach *et al* described
burnout as a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal
stressors on the job, and stated: 'What started out as important,
meaningful, and challenging work becomes unpleasant, unfulfilling, and
meaningless. Energy turns into exhaustion, involvement turns into
cynicism, and efficacy turns into ineffectiveness'.

Increased prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and burnout has been
established in studies from different parts of the world. A study of
Italian physicians found an estimated prevalence of psychiatric
morbidity to be 25%, and prevalence of burnout on the emotional
exhaustion scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to be 38.7%.^5^
Other studies have reviewed the factors associated with the development
and maintenance of psychiatric illness and burnout among doctors. A
survey of Australian doctors found that having medico-legal issues, not
taking a holiday in the previous year and working long hours were all
significantly associated with psychiatric morbidity.^6^ Self-criticism
as a medical student was significantly correlated with psychological
stress as a doctor in a cohort followed over 10 years by
Firth-Cozens.^7^

Burnout among doctors can lead to self-reported suboptimal patient
care,^8^ and to major medical errors.^9^ Psychiatric morbidity increases
the likelihood of retirement thoughts and retirement preference.^10^
Behavioural responses to burnout established in the literature also
include alcohol and drug misuse, physical withdrawal from co-workers,
increased absenteeism, arriving for work late and leaving early, and
employee turnover.^11^ An extreme reaction to stress can be suicide,
even though the pathway to this is complex and multifactorial. A UK
survey of suicides between 1979 and 1983 ranked the medical profession
as 10th in the list of high-risk professions.^12^

Mental ill health can be found within every workplace in every country.
In the UK the total cost to employers of mental health problems among
their staff is estimated at nearly £26 billion each year: £8.4 billion
from sickness absences and £15.1 billion from reduced productivity at
work.^13^ The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
found that promoting the mental well-being of employees can yield
economic benefits for the business or organisation, in terms of
increased commitment and job satisfaction, staff retention, improved
productivity and performance, and reduced staff absenteeism.^14^ For the
National Health Service (NHS) to reap the benefits described by NICE,
priority should be given to employee mental health. However, the
constant structural changes to the NHS in England have created
instability and lack of job security within the public health
workforce.^15^ The Health and Social Care Act of 2012 has placed doctors
at the centre of clinical commissioning groups in charge of shaping
services and made them responsible for £65 billion of the £95 billion
NHS commissioning budget.^16^ This imposes on doctors, especially
general practitioners (GPs), a responsibility unlike any before,^17^ one
which their training has not prepared them for. The ability to cope with
the challenges of working in the NHS and the possibility of stress and
burnout were highlighted in the annual meeting of the British Medical
Association in 2013,^18^ and are the focus of this review.

Numerous research papers document burnout and stress-related psychiatric
disorders in doctors worldwide, but none has presented the results in
the form of a systematic review showing the prevalence and associated
factors among UK doctors. The overall aim of this review was to redress
this by assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychiatric morbidity
among UK doctors working in different specialties, and to explore the
associated identified factors. The objectives were to review the
prevalence of the syndrome of burnout and psychiatric morbidity, to
explore the nature of the relationship between burnout and psychiatric
morbidity, and to identify other factors associated with the development
and/or perpetuation of those conditions.

# Method {#S1}

## Search strategies {#S2}

The words 'burnout' and 'doctors' were put into the search field of the
EBSCOhost website specifying the following databases: Academic Search
Complete, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES. Limiters activated
were: English language, human, apply related words, and a time limit of
January 1993 to December 2013. A total of 562 articles resulted from
this, reduced to 489 automatically after duplicates were removed; 28
articles were selected for further analysis, and out of these 9 remained
based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using the same
parameters but with the words 'psychiatric morbidity' AND 'doctors', a
total of 97 articles were generated, reduced to 77 after the removal of
duplicates, and from these only 1 was selected as new and appropriate.
Again using the same parameters but with the words 'stress' AND
'doctors' NOT 'nurses', 3560 articles came up, reduced to 2259 after
duplicates were removed; 23 new articles were reviewed in greater
detail, and from these 5 new and appropriate articles were selected.

An advanced search on PubMed with the words 'doctors' OR 'physicians'
AND 'stress', with a time limit of 1 January 1980 to 15 December 2013
and other limits (human, English language, clinical trial, journal
article, reviews, lectures) generated 5973 articles. After careful
analysis of the abstracts 28 new articles were identified for more
detailed review, and from these 10 were selected as new and appropriate.

Two searches within the group of British medical journals with the
phrases 'burnout and doctors' and 'doctors and stress' with the time
limit of January 1993 to December 2013 yielded two new and appropriate
papers.

A review of the reference lists of already-identified papers yielded
three relevant papers.

Altogether, this extensive search yielded 30 relevant papers which were
included in the units of analysis for this review ([Fig.
1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}).

## Inclusion criteria {#S3}

Certain criteria had to be met before a study was included in the units
of analysis: it had to answer any of the research questionsfor the
measurement of the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity the study had to
have used any version of the GHQ, and for the prevalence of burnout
syndrome only the MBI was consideredpopulation group -- only medical
doctors in the UK irrespective of which organisation they work inminimum
sample size of 50published between January 1993 and December
2013published in the English language.

## The questionnaires {#S4}

The GHQ is a well-validated and widely used screening tool for the
detection of minor psychiatric disorders (psychiatric morbidity) in the
general population.^19^ The GHQ-12 is self-administered and only takes
about 5min to complete. It enquires about the experience of psychosocial
and somatic symptoms in recent weeks. Each of the 12 items is measured
on a 4-point Likert scale. Studies validating the GHQ-12 against
standardised psychiatric interviews indicate that a cut-off score of 4
or above indicates a high probability that the individual suffers from a
clinically significant level of distress ('caseness' or psychiatric
morbidity).

The MBI is a 22-item self-report questionnaire, which is well recognised
and widely used to measure burnout in relation to occupational
stress.^20^ It has three subscales: personal accomplishment (measured by
8 items), depersonalisation (measured by 9 items) and emotional
exhaustion (measured by 5 items). Responses are rated for each item
according to frequency on a 7-point scale from 'never' to 'every day'.
The total score for each subscale is categorised 'low', 'average' or
'high' according to predetermined cut-off scores, based on normative
data from a sample of American health professionals. A high degree of
burnout is indicated by high scores on the emotional exhaustion and
depersonalisation subscales and low scores on the personal
accomplishment subscale.

## Data extraction {#S5}

A simple paper data extraction tool was created in Microsoft Word, and
the tables from this have been used to portray the results in the
results section. Data were extracted by the author over the months of
November and December 2013.

# Results {#S6}

A total of 30 papers considered relevant and appropriate based on the
study inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this review.

## Findings on prevalence {#S7}

Seven studies^21,22,24,25,27,30,50^ had quantifiable data on the
prevalence of both psychiatric morbidity and burnout (an in-depth
analysis of studies reviewed in this paper is included in an online data
supplement to this article). Altogether 22 studies reported on
prevalence of psychiatric morbidity, and the range was 17--52% (average
31%). GPs and consultants had the highest scores. Fourteen studies had
burnout scores, with nine reporting scores as percentages and five as
mean scores; one study^28^ had both percentage and mean burnout scores.
For emotional exhaustion the scores ranged from 31 to 54.3% and mean
scores ranged from 2.90 to 31.26; for depersonalisation the scores
ranged from 17.4 to 44.5% (1.95--15.68) and for low personal
accomplishment the range was 6--39.6% (4.36--34.21). GPs, consultants
and pre-registration house officers had the highest levels of burnout in
the studies.

McManus *et al*,^46^ in a UK-wide study carried out in 2009, had the
largest sample size at 2845 doctors and reported prevalence of
psychiatric morbidity at 19.2%. The other two UK-wide studies with
samples of over 1000 cutting across specialties and grades^23,43^
reported psychiatric morbidity prevalence rates of 27.8% and 21.3%,
respectively. Taylor *et al*^50^ reviewed 1308 consultants from
different specialties and found the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity
to be 32%.

One longitudinal study^30^ found no significant increase in the
prevalence of psychiatric morbidity over 3 years in a non-specific group
of doctors. Another longitudinal study^50^ found a significant increase
in psychiatric morbidity and emotional exhaustion among consultants over
8 years.

The only European Union (EU) study looking at the prevalence of burnout
in GPs from 12 EU countries^39^ found lower average scores on all
burnout scales compared with those of English GPs.

## Findings on associated factors {#S8}

Job satisfaction was found to be protective against the effect of stress
on emotional exhaustion. The number of hours worked, job stress and
overload were associated with increased psychiatric morbidity in eight
studies. Two studies^22,38^ found that women had significantly higher
psychiatric morbidity than men, but three studies^27,34,45^ did not find
any association with gender. The personality trait of neuroticism was
significantly associated with increase in psychiatric morbidity in three
studies,^35,43,47^ while conscientiousness was a protective factor.
Psychiatric morbidity was also positively associated with taking work
home and with the effect of stress on family life.

Job satisfaction was negatively correlated with burnout in three
studies.^21,22,25^ Age was an interesting factor; increased
depersonalisation was found in younger doctors in five
studies,^21,22,27,29,31^ whereas emotional exhaustion increased with age
in two studies.^22,41^ Being single was associated with increased
burnout scores, and neuroticism increased burnout significantly in two
studies.^43,47^ Increased job stress and workload increased burnout in
three studies, with significantly lower emotional exhaustion scores in
part-time GPs.

## Findings on the direct relationship between burnout and psychiatric morbidity {#S9}

Three studies^25,30,46^ found significant positive correlations between
psychiatric morbidity as measured by the GHQ, and burnout syndrome.
Using the process of casual modelling, McManus *et al*^30^ found that
when scores were considered in 1997 and later in 2000, emotional
exhaustion increased psychiatric morbidity, and *vice versa*. Personal
accomplishment increased emotional exhaustion directly, and increased
psychiatric morbidity directly but also indirectly through increasing
emotional exhaustion. When other mental health problems were considered,
anxiety and depression were found to increase psychiatric morbidity in
three studies,^35,37,38^ and depression increased depersonalisation.^41^

# Discussion {#S10}

The findings indicate that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among
UK doctors is quite high, ranging from 17 to 52%. This compares
unfavourably with the results from a longitudinal survey of people
living in private households within the UK, which found an 18-month
period prevalence of common mental disorders to be 21%.^51^ Only 4 of
the 22 studies that reported on psychiatric morbidity found prevalence
of less than 21%,^26,30,32,46^ which is slightly better than 27% found
in a study of palliative care physicians in Western Australia.^52^ An
earlier study of junior house officers in the UK found psychiatric
morbidity in 50% of doctors,^53^ but this was in a period when the
working pattern of junior doctors was relatively unregulated. More
recent studies of junior doctors contained in this review found the
prevalence of psychiatric morbidity to be around 19%.^26,32^ Concern
over increasing prevalence of common psychiatric illnesses was borne out
by the results from the study which found a 5% increase in morbidity
among a cohort of consultants over an 8-year period.^50^

This review also found a high prevalence of burnout among UK doctors
measured using the MBI. It lends further support to the growing body of
evidence which has found the syndrome of burnout to be prevalent all
over the world among health professionals. In a sample of Australian
doctors, 24% suffered burnout;^52^ in a New Zealand sample of medical
consultants one in five did;^54^ and in a cross-section of Japanese
doctors 19% were affected.^55^ This review found even higher rates of
burnout, with the prevalence of emotional exhaustion ranging from 31 to
54.3%, which would suggest UK doctors are comparatively more prone to
burnout. GPs generally had higher scores for burnout,^29^ particularly
in the study of European family doctors,^39^ which found that the only
countries in which GPs had higher burnout scores than England were
Turkey, Italy, Bulgaria and Greece. Emotional exhaustion among a cohort
of consultants was shown to have increased over an 8-year period,^50^
with a prevalence of 41% in 2002.

This review has been able to pool together different studies which
report on factors associated with the development and perpetuation of
psychiatric morbidity and burnout. Neuroticism was positively and
significantly correlated with psychological distress and burnout in
three studies.^35,43,47^ Neuroticism refers to a lack of psychological
adjustment and instability leading to a tendency to be stress-prone,
anxious, depressed and insecure, and it has been shown to negatively
predict extrinsic career success.^56^ McManus *et al*,^43^ in a 12-year
longitudinal study on a cohort of students who started studying medicine
in 1990, found that doctors who are more stressed and emotionally
exhausted showed higher levels of neuroticism all through their careers.
Neuroticism was also positively associated with perceived high workload.
The researchers concluded that neuroticism was not only a correlate but
a cause of work-related stress and burnout. Similar findings were noted
by Clarke & Singh^57^ in a study looking at the pessimistic explanatory
style of processing information, which is a manifestation of
neuroticism. In that study neuroticism was shown to positively predict
psychological distress in doctors, and the authors recommended that
susceptible doctors should be offered cognitive-behavioural therapy
(CBT) to alter their explanatory style.

In an editorial titled 'Why are doctors so unhappy?' Richard Smith
stated that the most obvious cause of doctors\' unhappiness was that
they feel overworked and under-supported.^58^ Job stress, feeling
overloaded and the number of hours worked were positively linked to
psychiatric 'caseness' and burnout in many of the studies in the present
review, and this cut across specialties and grades. A General Medical
Council (GMQ survey^59^ of doctors in training found that 22% felt their
working pattern leaves them short of sleep at work, and 59% said they
regularly worked beyond their rostered hours. Increasing job stress
without a commensurate increase in job satisfaction was associated with
the presence of psychiatric morbidity, and job satisfaction was also
positively correlated with illness in six of the reviewed studies
^21,22,25,34--36^ Another significant finding was the correlation
between psychiatric disorders and burnout, with the two feeding off each
other, leading to worsening outcomes.

The public health importance of these findings cannot be overemphasised.
GPs are at the frontline of healthcare delivery in the UK, and around
90% of all NHS contacts take place in primary care, with nearly 300
million GP consultations a year.^60^ The estimated total number of GP
consultations in England rose from 217.3 million in 1995 to 300.4
million in 2008, with a trebling of telephone consultations, and with
the highest consultation rates among the growing population of elderly
individuals.^61^ Increased live births of over 110 000 over the past 10
years,^62^ and an ageing population^63^ have contributed to the pressure
felt by services in general. However, in spite of the increased demand
on primary care services, the proportion of the NHS budget that is spent
on general practice has slumped to record levels, and GPs report that
this has compromised the quality of care they can provide.^64^ Under
these circumstances, the added expectation from the UK Department of
Health that GP surgeries should open for longer hours and should expand
patient choice will undoubtedly lead to even more psychological distress
and burnout among GPs.

A government-driven emphasis in the NHS on performance management and
targets increases job demands and stress among managers,^65^ and
increases psychiatric morbidity among doctors. The current climate of
austerity in the UK, and the expectation that doctors should continue to
provide high-quality care to patients within an NHS intending to make
£20 billion worth of savings,^66^ further expose doctors to burnout and
stress. Psychiatrists are already having to deal with the expected
increase in demand for mental health services stemming from the economic
downturn,^67^ and the increase in suicide rates^68^ among the
working-age population. Psychiatrists are particularly vulnerable to
burnout, and patient suicide is a factor significantly associated with
stress and burnout in this group ^69^

Burnout among doctors can affect the entire public health workforce
because as a syndrome it is considered 'contagious'.^4^ With the push
for doctors to take up leadership positions at every level within the
NHS a burnt-out doctor can negatively affect the entire healthcare
delivery system. Unhealthy coping strategies in response to burnout and
stress were identified in this review: these include retiring early,
taking work home, taking it out on family, mixing less with friends, and
avoidance, all of which work against the development of a healthy
work-life balance.

## Limitations {#S11}

Some key limitations are worth highlighting. First, all the studies were
cross-sectional surveys using questionnaires sent to the participants
online or by post. Response rates varied, with some as low as 17%, and
only in half of the studies was effort made to increase the response
rate by sending reminders or repeat questionnaires. Non-response bias
could have affected the results. Second, although the MBI was used in
all the studies examining burnout, different versions of the MBI were
utilised. With the GHQ some studies used the 28-item version but most
used the 12-item version. The cut-off for 'caseness' using the GHQ also
differed between studies and ranged between ⩾3 and ⩾5. However, these
differences may not have significantly affected the overall findings
given that a study to validate the two versions of the GHQ found no
difference between them, and also established that the different cut-off
for 'caseness' did not affect the questionnaire\'s validity.^2^

The cross-sectional method used for the surveys makes it difficult to
draw a firm conclusion on the outcomes from a cause and effect
perspective. Also, the number of potential confounders for the presence
of burnout and common psychiatric disorders is vast and cannot be
controlled for in surveys alone.

The fact that this literature review ends in 2013 may be considered a
limitation, but the hope is that this paper will trigger more research
in this area, and the author\'s intention is to update the literature
review by 2023.

## Recommendations {#S12}

Doctors are ultimately responsible for the quality of care they provide
at any time, and they need to be aware of their own vulnerability to
burnout and psychiatric illness, and of their impact on patient care.
Traditionally, doctors take pride in working a lot of hours,^70^ and are
3 to 4 times less likely to take days off sick compared with other
health professionals;^71^ this combination is a recipe for burnout. A
whole list of support networks is available on the GMC website,^72^ and
doctors should be encouraged to utilise these. However, there is a
'culture of fear' among doctors regarding the GMC, and 96 doctors, a lot
of whom had mental health problems, have died by suicide since 2004
while being investigated by the GMC.^73^ A lot more work is therefore
needed to make the most vulnerable doctors feel supported.

At an organisational level, approaches designed to reduce the workload
of doctors should be prioritised. Changes to doctors\' contract of
service should reflect an understanding of the impact of work-related
factors on the health and well-being of doctors, and any such contract
should contain the necessary protections to reduce the experience of
psychiatric illness and burnout. The benefits of a healthy workforce on
the quality of care provided in the NHS cannot be overstated.
