We hypothesised that there would be no significant differences in prescribing patterns in this clinician group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Method</title><sec id="S3"><title>Settings and sample</title><p id="P9">Covering a vast geographical area, the NHS trust studied is one of the largest in England and provides services in a variety of settings. Its secure hospitals feature one high secure hospital, two medium secure hospitals and one low secure hospital. Information on antipsychotic prescribing was collected on all in-patients with schizophrenia in these four hospitals in July 2014. A questionnaire was sent to the 34 consultant forensic psychiatrists based at the hospitals and 3 community-based consultant forensic psychiatrists working within the same trust.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S4"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="S5"><title>Prescribing patterns</title><p id="P10">In July 2014, the electronic healthcare records were used to produce a list of all current in-patients at the trust's four secure hospitals. The clinical records (electronic and paper healthcare records, and pharmacy records) were then used to ascertain which of these patients had schizophrenia. Further information was collected about patients with schizophrenia (gender, age, ethnicity, length of stay, antipsychotic medication prescribed), to produce an anonymised data-set detailing the percentage of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia at each hospital, and the proportion of patients with schizophrenia prescribed different types of antipsychotic medication.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Consultant questionnaires</title><p id="P11">Owing to the absence of a validated instrument, a semi-structured self-report questionnaire was developed to assess forensic consultants' attitudes to the prescription of oral and depot antipsychotic medications. The questionnaire was designed to take less than 5 min to complete. Consultants were asked in which level of security they worked and then three further questions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="P12">Disregarding the special case of clozapine, when treating a patient with schizophrenia do you have a general preference for either oral or depot antipsychotic medications? (Yes/No)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P13">Please indicate the strength of any preference on the scale below (0&#x02013;100 anchored Likert scale: 0 &#x02013; oral, 100 &#x02013; depot).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P14">What are the reasons behind any stated preference? ((a) Improves adherence, (b) Better clinical outcome, (c) More convenient for the patient, (d) More convenient for the clinical team, (d) The next level of security/community team would expect/prefer it).</p></list-item></list>
There was also space for a free-text response. The three community consultants were asked two further questions:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="P15">How important is the route of antipsychotic administration in your considering whether to accept a patient on to your caseload? (0&#x02013;100 anchored Likert scale: 0 &#x02013; very important, 100 &#x02013; not at all important).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P16">How likely are you to accept a patient currently prescribed an oral antipsychotic (not clozapine)? (0&#x02013;100 anchored Likert scale: 0 &#x02013; very unlikely, 100 &#x02013; very likely).</p></list-item></list>
The Likert scale is an ordinal psychometric assessment of attitudes or opinions, typically lacking concrete answers to accommodate neutral or undecided feelings. It was selected for this questionnaire owing to the speed and ease of completion, low cost, ease of distribution, and providing results amenable to analysis.</p><p id="P17">The Likert scale has been criticised for failing to measure the true attitudes of respondents, as it gives only 5 to 7 options of choice, and also for the space between each choice in reality possibly not being equidistant. In view of this, and in an attempt to further maximise freedom on behalf of the responder and to avoid railroading respondents into giving polarised responses, the Likert scale was amended to include some characteristics of an analogue scale.</p><p id="P18">The questionnaire was sent, with a cover letter, to all forensic consultants working in the four secure hospitals and in community forensic services in the NHS trust. After 3 months, the questionnaire was sent again to encourage non-responders. All data were supplied anonymously.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="P19">The project proposal was reviewed by the trust's research and innovations department and approved as service evaluation; research ethics approval was therefore not required. Patient anonymity was preserved throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Analytic strategy</title><p id="P20">SPSS version 21 (Windows 10) was used for data analysis. Chi-square and ANOVA were used where appropriate.

Future research could further explore the finding that BME patients are more likely to be prescribed a depot antipsychotic than their White counterparts.
