  **Aims and method** To review the literature to examine the factors
  that may be affecting recruitment into psychiatry in the UK. We
  systematically searched four databases to identify studies from 1974
  to 2016 and identified 27 papers that met the specified inclusion
  criteria.

  **Results** Most papers (*n* = 24) were based on questionnaire
  surveys. The population in all studies comprised of 1879
  psychiatrists, 6733 students and 220 746 trainees. About 4--7% of
  students opt for a career in psychiatry. Enrichment activities helped
  to attract students more towards psychiatry than just total time spent
  in the specialty. Job content in terms of the lack of scientific
  basis, poor prognosis and stigma towards psychiatry, work-related
  stress and problems with training jobs were common barriers
  highlighted among students and trainees, affecting recruitment. Job
  satisfaction and family-friendly status of psychiatry was rated highly
  by students, with lifestyle factors appearing to be important for
  trainees who tend to choose psychiatry.

  **Clinical implications** Negative attitudes and stigma towards
  psychiatry continue to persist. Teaching and training in psychiatry
  needs rethinking to improve student experience and recruitment into
  the specialty.

title: "Systematic review into factors associated with the recruitment
  crisis in psychiatry in the UK: students\\', trainees\\' and
  consultants\\' views"
---

Psychiatry as a career has been negatively regarded and unpopular among
medical students. About 3.6% of British graduates decide on a career in
psychiatry whereas about 6% are needed.^1^ From 2000 to 2011, the
absolute number of consultant psychiatrists in England rose from 2904 to
4394 (an increase of 51%), with similar increases in Scotland and Wales,
in line with the expansion of the consultant workforce in most secondary
care specialties.^1^ A need for more psychiatric consultant posts has
been predicted based on projections of increasing workloads due to the
increased population needs.^2^ A perceived fall in the proportion of UK
medical school graduates choosing a postgraduate career in psychiatry,
and low competition ratios for first-year core specialist training (CT1)
posts in psychiatry,^3--5^ has led to many questions about the way in
which psychiatry is taught at medical school and how psychiatry could be
made as an attractive career option.^6--8^

Low recruitment in psychiatry is a global issue, highlighted in a number
of publications.^9,10^ However, the problem also has country-specific
dimensions, as each country has different factors such as the pay scale
for the specialty, medical education system and training programmes,
which may attract or dissuade medical students from a career in
psychiatry. The subject has not been reviewed systematically especially
in the context of recruitment in the UK. The review question was: what
are the factors that influence recruitment to psychiatry as a career
choice and how can this be improved? The aim of this paper is to
systematically review the literature from the UK on psychiatry as a
career choice. We are specifically interested in identifying the factors
that influence the recruitment into psychiatry with emphasis on barriers
and facilitators affecting recruitment. A greater understanding of the
views ranging from medical students to trainees and consultants working
in the UK may enable curriculum developers and recruitment leads to
design programmes that attract students and trainees to psychiatry as a
career and improve students\' attitudes towards psychiatry in the long
term.

# Method {#S1}

We followed the PRISMA statement^11^ as a guide for conducting the
systematic review. The following electronic databases were searched from
1974 onwards: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO. These databases were
selected in view of the fact that almost all the literature published
from the UK would be covered in these databases. Keywords used in the
searches included: medical students, trainees, doctors, consultant,
attitudes, psychiatry, career, undergraduate psychiatry. Boolean
operations and truncations were added to allow for alternative endings
in the keyword searches. The search was last updated in August 2016.

We included studies that described a UK sample, were published in
English in a peer-reviewed journal and provided original data on careers
in psychiatry or factors affecting recruitment in psychiatry. We
excluded studies that had the primary objective of addressing other
issues that were not directly relevant to recruitment in psychiatry but
only mentioned their effects on career choice as a secondary effect.
Studies which provided data on medical careers in general were included
if these provided data relevant to psychiatric careers or recruitment.

The electronic search returned 601 relevant abstracts and titles. We
screened the titles and abstracts and excluded the studies that were not
directly relevant to the objectives of the review. Therefore we excluded
the studies that did not describe a UK sample or did not provide the
original data. We also excluded the studies that described the
recruitment to certain subspecialties and therefore not relevant to the
recruitment to psychiatry in general. After screening these titles and
abstracts we decided to examine 56 full text papers. Finally, we
included 27 papers in the review. Further details are provided in [Fig.
1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}. The studies were conducted in a number of
different populations, settings and periods, and also used diverse
methodologies varying from surveys to statistics derived from databases.
The 30-item Attitudes Towards Psychiatry (ATP-30),^12^ a validated tool
used to assess attitudes of students towards psychiatry, was used in
four papers; other papers used different questionnaires to assess
attitudes. Due to the diverse methodologies it was inappropriate to pool
the data to produce a statistical summary. We therefore describe the
main findings and produce a narrative summary of results.

## Characteristics of included studies {#S3}

[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} shows the characteristics of the 27
studies included in the review. The majority of studies (*n* = 24) were
surveys and questionnaire-based studies. The other studies included one
database study of doctors entering training posts and two retrospective
cohort studies, which looked at which medical school psychiatrists had
attended. These reported on medical students (*n* = 12), trainees (*n* =
10), medical students and trainees (*n* = 1), trainees and consultants
(*n* = 1) and consultants (*n* = 3). One of these studies looked at data
from postgraduate departments in different medical schools, and one
study reported on the database of applicants to MMC (Modernising Medical
Careers) for training posts.

:::

In survey-based studies response rates varied from 16% to 100%. Mean
response rate from the papers which had figures available (*n* = 20) was
63.3%. The population in all studies comprised of 1879 psychiatrists,
6733 students and 220 746 trainees. One database study^13^ looked at 31
434 trainee doctors, and studies by Goldacre *et al* were aimed at all
doctors in training, accounting for large numbers of respondents in the
trainee subcategory.^14--18^

## The influence of the medical school and teaching practices {#S4}

Most of the research addressing the influence of the medical school and
teaching practices on selecting psychiatry as a career was carried out
in the 1970\'s and 1980\'s. Two studies by Brook *et al*^19,20^ looked
at the medical school of origin for 531 psychiatrists between 1961 and
1970 and reported no significant relationship between schools that had a
professional unit or specific teaching programme and students pursuing
psychiatry in the long term. However, it was noted that those schools
that produced fewer psychiatrists tended to have either a recently
established professional unit or none.^19^

No clear pattern emerged in terms of the type of teaching offered at
each university and the impact this had on choice of psychiatry as a
career in the long term.^19^ All four Scottish schools, and Cambridge
and Oxford were noted to be higher in terms of producing psychiatrists,
attributed possibly to the well-established professional units such as
the Maudsley and Bethlem Royal hospitals.^19^ The personality, charisma
and enthusiasm of teachers were associated with an increase in the
uptake of psychiatry in the long term.^19,21^

Brook *et al*^21^ found that the effectiveness of teaching rather that
the amount of teaching had an effect on student attitudes and
recruitment into psychiatry The attitude of non-psychiatric teachers
appeared to be influential with doctors experiencing negative attitudes
of other doctors towards psychiatry.^21^ The two hospitals which ranked
top in terms of producing psychiatrists had changed their teaching
model. One stressed the importance of psychiatry as being part of
general medicine, emphasising the effectiveness of physical therapy,
whereas the other placed emphasis on liaison psychiatry and
psychotherapy.^21^

More recent work by Collier *et al*^22^ looked into the teaching time
allocated for psychiatry in foundation programmes across the country.
They found that only 2.3% of teaching was dedicated to psychiatry
compared with 44.1% to medical and surgical topics.^22^ Exposure to
psychiatry remained limited with 4 out of 17 hospitals in the survey not
having any teaching on psychiatry for medical students.^22^ Doctors
generally led a higher proportion of medicine and surgery teaching
sessions (63%) compared with psychiatry (48%).^22^

## Medical students\' views of psychiatry and factors affecting career choice {#S5}

Twelve studies examined the factors affecting medical students\' career
choice and one study looked at both medical students and trainees.
Petrides *et al*^23^ studied the theoretical understanding of how
different medical specialties are perceived and how choices are made.
Psychiatrists were found to have a more artistic approach to medicine,
seeing interpreting and responding imaginatively to a range of medical,
social, ethical and other problems. This is in keeping with early work
by Levine *et al*^24^ who also found that there was a group of students
who were 'psychologically minded' and they could be identified and
encouraged to make psychiatry as career choice.

Budd *et al*^26^ found that job satisfaction (98%, *n* = 128) and
family-friendly status of psychiatry (79%, *n* = 103) were important for
students who rated psychiatry as one of their top three choices.^26^ The
academic status was significantly less important (48%) for students who
placed psychiatry as their top three specialty schools *v.* 63% for
those who did not place psychiatry in their top three choice.^26^

## Choice of psychiatry as a career among medical and sixth form students {#S6}

The number of students choosing psychiatry has remained fairly stable at
around 4--7%.^25--27^ Three per cent of students from six medical
schools placed psychiatry as their first choice, with 18% seriously
considering it.^20^ Halder *et al*^28^ found similar results in 18
medical schools; 16% chose psychiatry as a future career on entering
medical school but by the final year only 3% had decided to pursue a
career in the subject. These results were replicated by Farooq *et
al*^27^ In a survey of sixth form students, Maidment *et al*^29^
reported that 60.9% (*n* = 363) indicated that it would be very likely
or they would definitely want to pursue psychiatry as a career. In terms
of overall intentions to pursue a career in a specialty, the ratings for
psychiatry was similar to general medicine at 12.4% (*n* = 72) *v.*
12.2% (*n* = 69) respectively.^29^

## Effect of undergraduate attachment and education on choosing psychiatry as a career {#S7}

Positive attitudes towards psychiatry and the influence by a teacher
during the attachment correlated with an intention to purse psychiatry
as a career in the long term.^29--31^ Three studies highlighted the
importance of psychiatric attachment. Student attitudes improved as the
attachment progressed.^26,30,31^ Maidment *et al*^29^ found 1.4% of
fourth-year medical students expressed a definite intention to pursue
which rose to 4.7% after their attachment.^29^ McParland *et al*^30^
reported that 19% (*n* = 58/309) of students were very attracted to
psychiatry or had a definite intention to pursue psychiatry at the start
of the placement, which increased to 27% (*n* = 101/373) of students at
the end of the attachment. The importance of the undergraduate
experience was highlighted by a recent study showing 50% of consultants
and 37% of trainees surveyed decided on a career in psychiatry while
still at medical school.^32^

Calvert *et al*^33^ looked into the attitudes of medical students
towards psychiatry and psychiatric patients at year 1, 3 and 5 in
medical school. First-year medical students were more likely to have
stereotypical views compared with third- and fifth-year students, and
were more likely to agree with statements such as 'Psychiatry deals with
imaginary illness' (mean 1.4, s.d. = 0.9, *P* \< 0.5).^33^ Fifth-year
students (mean 3.2, s.d. = 1.4) showed lower agreement than third-year
medical students (mean 3.6, s.d. = 1.2, *P* \< 0.5) with the statement
'Psychiatry is as a challenging career'.^33^ As they progressed through
medical school, students recognised that mental illness has serious
morbidity and that people do recover from mental illness,^33^ showing
that attitudes towards psychiatric patients improved with greater
clinical experience but possibly became more negative towards psychiatry
as a career.

Other factors that appeared to affect students positively included
enrichment activities, i.e. activities beyond standard teaching and
clinical placements led to a significantly increased interest in
psychiatry.^28^ These included research experience in psychiatry (13%
*v.* 4% in those not interested in psychiatry, *P* = 0.001), university
psychiatry clubs (38% *v.* 11%, *P* \< 0.001), psychiatry electives (14%
*v.* 1%, *P* \< 0.001) and psychiatry special study modules (38% *v.*
16%, *P* \< 0.001).^28^

McParland *et al*^30^ identified factors which increased interest in
psychiatry, including: influence or encouragement by someone during the
attachment (74%, *n* = 282), particularly the influence by consultants
(43%, *n* = 163), exposure to interesting and stimulating ideas (29%,
*n* = 110), liking someone\'s approach (27%, *n* = 103), feeling someone
believed in their ability (11%, *n* = 41) and having formed close
working relationships (9%, *n* = 33).^30^ Other factors that had a
significant impact were: receiving encouragement from the consultants
(*n* = 374, *P* \< 0.001, *r* = 0.26), seeing patients respond to
treatment (*n* = 374, *P* \< 0.001, *r* = 0.20) and having a direct role
in the involvement of patient care (*n* = 374, *P* \< 0.001, *r* =
0.26).^30^

## Factors which did not affect career choice of medical students {#S8}

Seeing patients in different settings or different phases of the illness
had no effect on career choice of medical students when deciding their
career intentions.^28^ Interestingly, one study found that the earning
potential and status of psychiatry had no effect on selecting psychiatry
as a career choice.^26^ Other factors related to teaching such as
quality of rating of small group teaching and lectures,^28^ the
curriculum type used^30,31^ and performance at viva examinations and
multiple choice questions also had no effect on the career choice.^31^

## Factors discouraging medical students to choose psychiatry as a career {#S9}

Curtis-Barton *et al*^25^ in their survey (*n* = 467) found that the
factors discouraging students to pursue a career in psychiatry included:
prognosis of patients (62%), perception that there is a lack of evidence
in diagnosis (51%), lack of scientific basis (53%) and the amount of
bureaucracy and paperwork in the specialty (48%). Other discouraging
factors included the stigma towards psychiatry (30%), the standing of
the profession among medical colleagues (31%) and comments by other
specialists (26%).^25,34^ Psychiatry scored the lowest among the
specialties as a career choice. Students described psychiatry as boring,
unscientific, depressing, stressful, frustrating and 'not enjoying the
rotation'.^35^

Many students experienced psychiatry as being different to other
specialties. For some this was a reason not to pursue psychiatry as a
career but for others it was a positive aspect of the specialty Students
felt ward rounds focused on 'social issues' rather than medical
conditions. Some found it an 'emotional burden' and others felt that
psychiatry could not 'fix' people and no one is being cured.^34^

A survey by Korszun *et al*^36^ examined the views of trainee, academics
and clinicians on students not taking up psychiatry. The following
factors were identified as deterring the students from psychiatry:
negative attitudes towards psychiatrists from other doctors and health
professionals (57%), stigmatisation of psychiatry (40%), stigma
associated with mental health disorders (39%), poor teaching and role
modelling from psychiatrists (37%), psychiatry not seen as medical or
scientific enough (26%) and poor morale among psychiatrists (26%).^36^

## Factors affecting trainees\' and consultants\' choice of psychiatry {#S10}

Fazel *et al*^13^ found that psychiatry was the sixth most popular
specialty out of ten specialty groups for trainees applying for training
places. A higher proportion of female graduates were shown to choose
psychiatry between 1974 (32%) and 1999 (59%).^13^ However, a more recent
survey showed a slight decline in the number of women choosing
psychiatry over the last decade, 4.9% (1999) *v.* 4.6 % (2009).^17^

Goldacre *et al*^14^ examined career choices for medical students over
the past 40 years. The number of doctors choosing psychiatry as a career
has hardly changed and remains around 4--5%, which is similar to figures
from 1975.^14^ It was noted that students who went on to work in
psychiatry 10 years after graduation, 52% (224 out of 428) had chosen
psychiatry in the first year after graduation and 71% (308 out of 434)
had chosen it in year 3.^14^

In common with the factors attracting students towards psychiatry,
numerous studies identified factors that appear to attract trainees
towards psychiatry The major attractions for choosing psychiatry are
listed in [Box 1](#box1){ref-type="boxed-text"}. Denman *et al*^32^
found that the most common factor influencing core trainees\' (60%) and
consultants\' (70%) decisions to specialise in psychiatry was emphasis
on the patient as a whole.^32^ Trainees highlighted that mental health
was an area of need (53%) and empathy and concerns for people with
mental illness (53%) were important reasons for choosing psychiatry.^32^

**Box 1** Factors attracting medical students and trainees in pursuing
psychiatry as a career

### Medical students {#S11}

-   Encouragement by colleagues^24,26,30,31^

-   Influence by someone during the placement^24,30^

-   Females are more likely to favour a career in psychiatry^24,27,30^

-   Family history of mental illness was associated with choosing
    psychiatry^24^

-   Quality of experience^26,27,30,33^

-   Role models can have a positive impact on students pursuing a career
    in psychiatry^28,30,33^

-   Enrichment activities^27,28^

### Trainees {#S12}

-   Hours and conditions of work^17,31,32^

-   The doctor\'s personal assessment of their aptitudes and
    skills,^17,31,32^ for example recognising factors such as using
    one\'s intellect to help others^37^

-   Experience of the subject as a student^17,31^

-   Inclinations before medical school and a positive student
    experience^17,37^

    mentally ill people^32^

## Barriers associated with not choosing psychiatry as a long-term career choice for trainees {#S13}

Barras & Harris^38^ explored trainee\'s experiences (*n* = 359) within
psychiatry. Trainee attitudes were grouped into different categories.
The attitudes towards psychiatry (12.6%), professional role (12%) and
day-to-day working (11.3%) were identified as the main negative factors.
Trainees raised concerns with the training programmes in psychiatry,
such as problems with the rota and not having enough time with
patients.^38^ Many trainees felt frustrated with the Annual Review of
Competence Progression (ARCP) process and workplace-based assessments,
as well as the duplication of paperwork being a constant
frustration.^38^

The studies identified a number of barriers against choosing psychiatry
as a career ([Box 2](#box2){ref-type="boxed-text"}).

Trainees felt improvements were needed in terms of training
opportunities and felt this could be enhanced by providing a variety of
jobs, increasing research opportunities and increasing medical aspects
of training.^38^

Work looking into consultant psychiatrists\' views into why they chose
psychiatry was limited to two papers.^32,39^ Dein *et al*^39^ found that
the majority of consultants (46%) chose psychiatry as a career soon
after leaving medical school, and a recent study surveying consultants
in the West Midlands found that 50% had made their choice by graduation
from medical school.^32^ The main reasons cited by consultants for
choosing psychiatry as a career included: empathy for those with a
mental disorder (36.1%), interface with neuroscience (25%), expectation
of better working conditions in psychiatry (20%) and influence of
teaching at medical school (19.4%).^39^ Denman *et al*^32^ highlighted
several 'very important' reasons for consultants choosing psychiatry
including: career in psychiatry would be intellectually challenging
(60%), sense of fulfilment expected from seeing patients improve (47%)
and enjoyment of problem-solving (47%). Lifestyle factors such as
salary, better working conditions and quality of life were shown to be
more important reasons for choosing psychiatry for trainees compared
with consultants.^32^

**Box 2** Barriers associated with not choosing psychiatry as a career

-   Job content (71.7%) (*n* = 71) (including the lack of scientific
    basis, job not being clinical, poor prognosis)^15,17,25,35,36,38^

-   Poor public image of psychiatry^15,25,36^

-   Lack of respect towards psychiatry as a specialty by other
    specialties^15,25,36^

-   Work-related stress cited by (49%)^15^ trainees in psychiatry^38^

-   25--50% of trainees leaving psychiatry as a specialty cited lack of
    resources as one of the main reasons which was significantly more
    than those rejecting general practice and trauma and
    orthopaedics^15,38^

-   25--50% of trainees leaving psychiatry^15,16,38^ highlighted:

    a.  lack of adequately supervised training

    b.  lack of evidence base to diagnosis and treatment

    c.  lack of improvement in patients

    d.  work-life balance

    e.  work not clinical enough

-   Physical risks involved in the job^15^

-   Sense of eroded professionalism^36,38^

-   Too much paperwork and duplication^25,36,38^

-   Problems with rota and not enough time with patients^38^

-   Trainees leaving the scheme felt frustrated with workplace-based
    assessments^38^

-   Low morale among workforce^33^

-   Future role of psychiatrists being eroded^33^

# Discussion {#S14}

This is the first systematic review of literature which examined factors
that influence the choice of psychiatry as a career in the UK. The main
findings are that enrichment activities help to attract students more
towards psychiatry than just total time spent in the specialty. Job
satisfaction and family-friendly status of psychiatry was rated highly
by students who tend to choose psychiatry. Role models and encouragement
from consultants may increase the number of students who want to pursue
psychiatry as a career. The major factors that appeared to dissuade
medical students/trainees from pursuing psychiatry as a career included:
an apparent lack of scientific basis of psychiatry and work not being
clinical enough, perception that psychiatry is more concerned about
social issues, the bureaucracy, paperwork, apparent poor prognosis of
patients, stigma towards psychiatry as a specialty, low morale, and
onerous workloads as a consultant.

We are aware of one previous systematic review that examined medical
students\' attitudes towards psychiatry internationally.^40^ In common
with our study this systematic review alongside another survey of
psychiatrists^36^ highlighted the stigma towards mental illness as a
major barrier influencing negative medical views towards psychiatry.^40^
Stigma towards psychiatry as a specialty arises from a variety of
sources, notably from medical students themselves. In addition, this
stigma could arise from ward staff attitudes towards patients and from
other doctors in other specialties, which detract students.^13,25,34^

Other reviews have looked at one aspect such as the effect of clinical
experience of psychiatry on medical students\' attitudes towards the
specialty.^41^ Lyons^40^ highlighted the impact of poor-quality teaching
leading to negative attitudes towards psychiatry and highlighted the
need to address psychiatry curricula and introduce novel teaching
strategies.^40^ El-Sayeh *et al*^42^ have previously highlighted the
importance of teaching and the various methods which could be utilised
to try to improve the student experience and in turn help attract
students towards psychiatry. The recent survey by Korszun *et al*^36^
highlighted that the number of clinicians compared with academics and
trainees agreed that they did not have time to teach medical students
(*P* \< 0.001). Both clinicians (42%) and academics (47%) felt that
teaching medical students did not contribute to their future career
prospects compared with 21% of trainees (*P* \< 0.001)^36^ Fewer
clinicians considered teaching to be a significant component of their
appraisal compared with trainees and academics.^36^ The combination of
poor teaching practices due to lack of resources or commitment and the
stigma reinforce the poor image of psychiatry.

We feel that the findings of our study support the recommendations made
by Mukherjee *et al*^43^ which identify a number of steps to address the
crisis in psychiatry recruitment at different nodal points in a medical
career, i.e. prior to entry to medical school, during medical education
and after graduation.

## Improving recruitment {#S15}

This study highlights the need to change the experience of psychiatry at
undergraduate and postgraduate level in keeping with work by Shah *et
al*^44^ who highlighted early medical experience, influence of seniors
and the aspects related to working environment as areas that could be
affected positively which in turn could have a positive effect on
choosing psychiatry as a career. Kelley *et al*^45^ highlighted the
impact of foundation programme experience in psychiatry, with a
significantly higher proportion of trainees pursuing a career in
psychiatry compared with those without any exposure to psychiatry (14.9%
*v.* 1.8%). This correlates with earlier findings by Shah *et al*^44^
that found a significant correlation between those Scottish students
considering psychiatry as a career and having held a psychiatry
post.^43^ A recent survey by Denman *et al*^32^ showed that 43% of
psychiatry trainees made their decision to specialise in psychiatry
during the foundation years, correlating with increased exposure to
psychiatry during the foundation years with 80% of trainees in this
survey completing a post in psychiatry during the foundation years.
Specific enrichment activities beyond standard teaching and clinical
placements such as research experience in psychiatry, university
psychiatry clubs, summer schools,^46^ psychiatry electives and
psychiatry special study modules appear to be a way in which medical
students will gain invaluable experiences and improve their attitudes to
psychiatry. These need to be adopted and evaluated in future programmes
to enhance recruitment in psychiatry Collier *et al*^22^ found that only
2.3% of teaching was dedicated to psychiatry compared with 44.1% to
medical and surgical topics, which does not help the poor image of
psychiatry. This and similar issues need to be addressed at
institutional level.

A number of studies found that psychiatry has a perception that it is
not a 'scientific' or 'medical' discipline.^15,36,38^ Medical students
and trainees expressed the views about the weakened medical identity of
psychiatry. The erosion of the role of the psychiatrist was cited by
some psychiatry trainees as a potential factor that would make them
consider leaving psychiatry training.^38^ This unfortunately is not
helped by negative comments or 'bad-mouthing' of psychiatry.^36,47^

Interventions such as anti-stigma films and Medfest^48^ have been shown
to improve medical students\' attitudes to psychiatrists, serious mental
illness and psychiatry, at least in the short term.^48,49^ However, it
appears that there is need to reconsider the content of psychiatric
training and the undergraduate curriculum. It has been suggested that
moving undergraduate teaching from in-patient to general hospital
settings such as liaison psychiatry will allow students to see patients
with problems that are relevant to medical practice.^47^ Setting up and
evaluating such programmes that have the potential to offer a different
and enjoyable experience for medical students and foundation doctors
should be a priority to improve the image of and recruitment into
psychiatry.

## Limitations {#S16}

A limitation of the study is that almost all data are based on surveys
and databases. This represents a cross-sectional view on the subject.
The lack of any comparisons with other specialties, which may have
similar recruitment rates, is particularly concerning. The focus on UK
studies is also a limitation but was necessary to understand the factors
affecting recruitment in this country We noted with some concern that
there are only a few studies that address the positive aspects of
psychiatry,^26--28,30--33^ which may attract students and trainees
towards psychiatry, and how these can be used for improving the
recruitment. Future studies need to address this gap in the literature.
Finally, we feel that the problems underlying the recruitment in
psychiatry perhaps also reflect the lack of parity of esteem. Unless
mental health is valued equally with physical health, the misconceptions
and distorted perceptions about psychiatry as a discipline in which a
medical career can be fruitfully pursued will linger on and will hinder
aspiring physicians from considering psychiatry as a career option.
