:Abstract:
   **Aims and Method** Suicidal acts on underground railway networks are
   an area of public health concern. Our aim was to review recent
   epidemiological patterns of suicidal acts on the London Underground
   to inform future preventive interventions. Data from 2000 to 2010
   were obtained from the British Transport Police via a Freedom of
   Information request.

   **Results** The mean annual rate of suicidal acts from 2000 to 2010
   was 5.8 per 100 million passenger journey stages. Of those who died
   by suicide, 77.3% were of White Northern European ethnicity. A fifth
   had a history of mental illness.

   **Clinical implications** The widening gap between the number of
   recorded suicide attempts and completed suicides is encouraging.
   Further research is required regarding the role of drug and alcohol
   use, psychiatric history and area of residence. Installation of
   platform screen doors should be considered in future railway network
   expansion.

The London Underground was built in 1863 End was the world's first
underground railway system.\ :sup:`(n.d.a)` Today it comprises 11 train
lines serving a total of 270 stations across 402 km.\ :sup:`(n.d.a)` In
2015/16 it saw the completion of 1.34 billion journeys across its
network.\ :sup:`(n.d.a)` Suicide on underground railway systems is a
major cause for public health concern. Railway suicide can have a
traumatic impact on both train drivers\ :sup:`(n.d.b)` and witnesses,
and can lead to significant train delays, with substantial economic
consequences.\ :sup:`(n.d.c)`

Between 1940–49 and 1980–89 the mean number of suicidal acts per year on
the London Underground rose from 36.1 to 94.1.\ :sup:`(n.d.d)` Previous
studies have suggested an association between the rising number of
suicidal acts across the national railway and increasing volumes of
passengers across railway networks;\ :sup:`(n.d.e),(n.d.f)` however,
this finding has been inconsistent across studies.\ :sup:`(n.d.g)` Use
of preventive measures to stop suicidal acts on railways has been the
focus of several studies, for example, concentrating on changes to the
immediate environment, media reporting and interagency
collaborations.\ :sup:`(n.d.h)`

Our aim was to review recent epidemiological patterns of suicidal acts
on the London Underground to better inform future preventive
interventions.

Method
======

Data covering deaths by suicide between 2004 and 2010 and ‘person under
train’ incidents between 2000 and 2010 were obtained by one of the
authors (M.R.) on 7 October 2011 through a Freedom of Information
request to the British Transport Police. Data covering completed
suicides between 2000 and 2003 could not be provided owing to changes in
coding. No further information in relation to this was provided by the
British Transport Police.

The data provided by the British Transport Police included demographic
information (age, gender, ethnicity) of suicide victims between 2004 and
2010. Age was categorised as: <15 years, 15–44 years, 45–74 years and >
75 years. The authors also received figures pertaining to all suicide
attempts (which included incidents where individuals were prevented from
jumping in front of a train or accessing the tracks) and all ‘person
under train’ incidents (intentional and accidental) between 2000 and
2010.

Information regarding the total number of journeys completed on the
London Underground was obtained from the publicly accessible Transport
for London (TfL) 2011 *Travel in London* report.\ :sup:`(n.d.i)`
Passenger journeys were recorded as ‘journey stages’, where a journey
stage represents a segment of a trip made on a particular mode of
transport. For example, a journey made up of two stages could include a
walking stage to the Underground station followed by a second stage on
the Underground network.\ :sup:`(n.d.j)`

Results
=======

Between 2000 and 2010 there were 644 recorded suicide attempts on the
London Underground. The mean annual rate of suicide attempts during this
period was 5.8 per 100 million journey stages (95% CI 5.0–6.5). Between
2004 and 2010 there were 132 deaths by suicide. The mean annual rate of
individuals who died by suicide during this period was 1.8 per 100
million journey stages (95% CI 1.4–2.2). In addition, there were 38
deaths in which the coroner recorded an open verdict and 9 deaths in
which the inquest had not yet taken place or in which the British
Transport Police did not have access to the outcome of the verdict. The
total number of ‘person under train’ incidents between 2000 and 2010,
which included both intentional and accidental acts, was 433. The mean
annual rate of ‘person under train’ incidents during this period was 3.9
per 100 million journey stages (95% CI 3.6–4.2).

`Figure 1 <#F1>`__ shows an increase in the number of suicide attempts
from 2004 to 2009, which is more marked than the increase in the number
of incidents of death by suicide. The number of ‘person under train’
incidents, however, remained relatively constant. Our data revealed a
small increase in the number of suicide attempts and ‘person under
train’ incidents during May–August, with a peak in June, as illustrated
in `Fig. 2 <#F2>`__.

Tables `1 <#T1>`__ and `2 <#T2>`__ display the age and ethnicity
distribution for males and females in incidents of deaths by suicide
2004–2010. Age at death was not available for two male individuals, and
ethnicity data were not available for one male individual. Of the deaths
by suicide, two-thirds (*n* = 88) were male and a third (*n* = 44) were
female. The average age at death was 40.7 years in males and 45.5 years
in females.

Of the 132 individuals who completed suicide on the London Underground,
110 (83.3%) were resident in London at the time of the event.
Information was unavailable for one individual. A history of mental
illness was confirmed in 20.5% of individuals (*n* = 27).

The Northern Line had the greatest number of recorded suicide attempts
(*n* = 145) between 2000 and 2010, followed by the Central Line (*n* =
99) and Piccadilly Line (*n* = 92). The lowest numbers of suicide
attempts during that period were recorded on the Jubilee Line (*n* = 27)
and Bakerloo Line (*n* = 33).

King's Cross St Pancras station saw the highest number of suicide
attempts between 2000 and 2010 (*n* = 18), followed by Mile End (*n* =
17), Victoria (*n* = 16), Camden Town (*n* = 15), Archway (*n* = 13),
Liverpool Street (*n* = 13), Oxford Circus (*n* = 12), Green Park (*n* =
12) and Earl's Court (*n* = 11). Suicide attempts led to delays in
underground railway services; between 2000 and 2010 the Northern Line
and Piccadilly Line experienced the greatest total delays (8484 min and
5521 min, respectively). The Jubilee Line recorded total delays of 2396
min and the Bakerloo Line 1911 min over the same period (`Fig.
3 <#F3>`__).

Suicide patterns over time
--------------------------

There was a marked increase in the number of suicide attempts across the
London Underground from 2004 onwards, although this trend was beginning
to reverse in 2009. Although there was also a rise in deaths by suicide
during that period, this was of a lesser degree. In their 2016 paper
looking at suicide trends across the entire England and Wales railway
system, Taylor *et al* found that male suicide rates had increased from
6 to 8.4 per million from 2000 to 2013, with the greatest increase
observed between 2010 and 2013, from 6.4 to 8.4 per
million.\ :sup:`(n.d.k)` By contrast, female suicide rates remained
relatively constant. Although previous studies looking at suicide
attempts on underground railway systems have suggested a case fatality
rate of 43 to 55%\ :sup:`(n.d.d),(n.d.l),(n.d.m)` (compared with 90% on
overground railways\ :sup:`(n.d.n)`), this does not fully explain the
extent of the difference observed. Increased reporting of suicide
attempts by London Underground staff may be a factor, as well as the
introduction of preventive interventions allowing for the early
identification of persons at risk.

TfL has worked towards suicide prevention since the
1990s.\ :sup:`(n.d.o)` This has included strategically placed Samaritans
campaign posters and telephones within stations. More recently there has
been further collaborative work with the Samaritans to train staff in
identifying persons at risk, and giving them the confidence to
intervene.\ :sup:`(n.d.p)` Additional interventions have included
platform-edge barriers on the Jubilee Line and gates to prevent
passengers from entering tunnels at existing stations, as well as use of
video surveillance and markings/warning signs to prevent individuals
from approaching the platform edge.\ :sup:`(n.d.o)` Presence of staff on
platforms during rush-hour periods may also be helpful. The increase in
the number of suicide attempts and deaths by suicide in 2008 and 2009
may in part be explained by the financial crisis of
2008.\ :sup:`(n.d.q)`

The number of journey stages made on the London Underground increased
from 0.976 million in 2004 to 1.065 million in 2009.\ :sup:`(n.d.i)`
There have been several studies exploring a potential link between
higher numbers of passenger journeys and the incidence of suicide, with
variable findings. Sonneck *et al* found no such association on the
Viennese subway,\ :sup:`(n.d.g)` whereas in Stockholm, Sweden, and The
Netherlands, authors noted a positive
association.\ :sup:`(n.d.e),(n.d.f)` Although Waterloo station is the
busiest in terms of passenger flow,\ :sup:`(n.d.r)` it does not feature
in the top 20 stations for suicide attempts on the London Underground in
2000–2010.

Our data did not reveal any marked variation in suicide attempts across
the year, although there was a small increase in events during May to
August, with a peak in June. Findings in other studies have been
variable. Although Dinkel *et al* found no association between seasons
of the year and suicide events,\ :sup:`(n.d.s)` others have noted a
small increase in suicide events during the summer
months\ :sup:`(n.d.d)` or during the months of April and
September.\ :sup:`(n.d.t)` Even though summer months are associated with
higher numbers of tourists in London, it is unclear whether this has had
an effect on the number of suicide attempts during those months.
Although a majority of those who died by suicide on the London
Underground were mostly resident in the city, the time of year of their
death was not available, nor was the proportion of London residents
represented among those individuals who attempted suicide.

.. _S5:

Demographics
------------

The stark overrepresentation of men in the 15- to 44-year age group
(61.4%, *n* = 57) among those who died by suicide was in keeping with
national figures (England), where the proportion of males is
approximately two-thirds.\ :sup:`(n.d.u)` The overall gender
distribution of suicide victims on the London Underground was very
similar to that recorded nationally during the same period (2004–2010),
with 66.9% of cases being male and 33.1% female. By contrast, the
proportion of females aged over 75 years was almost double that of males
(6.8% and 3.5% respectively), although the numbers were very small and
therefore need to be interpreted with caution.

This is the first study looking at the ethnic distribution of suicide
victims on the London Underground. The predominance of individuals of
White Northern European background (>75%) is significant in a place like
London where people of White ethnic background make up less than 60% of
the total population,\ :sup:`(n.d.v)` in particular since 83.3% of
individuals who died by suicide on the London Underground were resident
in the city. Moreover, use of the London Underground is evenly
distributed across different ethnicities.\ :sup:`(n.d.w)` There are
currently no data available on the ethnicity of individuals who die by
suicide nationally, hence we do not know whether individuals of White
Northern European ethnicity are also overrepresented relative to other
ethnic groups. Similarly, we do not know whether individuals of White
Northern European ethnicity are overrepresented in suicide incidents
occurring across the rest of the national railway network or involving
violent suicide methods.

In our sample a fifth of individuals had a history of mental illness.
Unfortunately, no further data were available regarding their diagnosis,
level of psychiatric care at the time of suicide or whether they were
current or recent in-patients of a psychiatric unit. Proximity of
stations or railway suicide ‘hot spots’ to psychiatric hospitals has
been highlighted as a risk factor for suicide in several
studies,\ :sup:`(n.d.d),(n.d.e),(n.d.l),(n.d.x),(n.d.y)` although the
result was not found to be significant across the Stockholm railway
system.\ :sup:`(n.d.e)` In their 1987 study of 100 individuals who had
attempted suicide on the London Underground, Cocks found that 13 were
current psychiatric in-patients, and 2 had been discharged within 48 h
of the event.\ :sup:`(n.d.z)` Fifteen individuals had expressed suicidal
ideation in the 24 h preceding the event. Although proximity to a
psychiatric hospital was not taken into account in this paper, the
presence of a history of mental illness in a fifth of those who died by
suicide highlights the need for staff working in psychiatric hospitals
to be aware of the proximity of any nearby Underground stations in their
assessment of risk in patients.

.. _S6:

Additional risk factors
-----------------------

In Stockholm, authors found that the stations with the highest suicide
rates were associated with higher levels of surrounding drug-related
crime.\ :sup:`(n.d.aa)` Previous studies have shown that consumption of
alcohol or drugs was a characteristic of about 10 to 20% of individuals
who had attempted or died by suicide on an underground railway
system.\ :sup:`(n.d.l),(n.d.ab),(n.d.ac)` In the UK National
Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental
Illness, the authors noted that 54% of those who died by suicide and had
been in contact with mental health services over the past year had a
history of alcohol and/or drug misuse.\ :sup:`(n.d.ad)` Intoxication
with drugs or alcohol can increase the risk of impulsive and risk-taking
behaviour and may have been a contributing factor in the incidents
observed on the London Underground, including ‘person under train’
incidents of accidental cause. Unfortunately, the British Transport
Police do not currently collect this information. Consumption of alcohol
on the London Underground is forbidden; however, consideration must be
given as to how to manage the risk of suicidal behaviour or accidental
injury in intoxicated individuals.

.. _S7:

Use of preventive measures
--------------------------

Several recent studies looking at suicide attempts on underground and
overground railway systems have focused on the use of preventive
measures. Diminishing ease of access to the track through barrier
methods is suggested as an effective intervention, although Cox *et al*
noted a lack of studies demonstrating this.\ :sup:`(n.d.ae)` In Seoul,
the presence of platform screen doors (PSDs) reduced suicides on the
underground network by 89%.\ :sup:`(n.d.af)` PSDs are continuous panels
that separate the platform from the train, only opening when the train
is in the station. Half-length PSDs (1.6 m) were less effective than
full-length PSDs; however, full-length PSDs were 120–150% more expensive
to install.\ :sup:`(n.d.af)` The effectiveness of PSDs was also noted in
Hong Kong.\ :sup:`(n.d.ag)` Portions of the Jubilee Line include the
presence of PSDs, which may be a contributory factor to the lower number
of suicide attempts observed on this line relative to the rest of the
network. The presence of PSDs would also reduce the risk of accidental
falls on to the railway tracks, thus reducing the number of ‘person
under train’ incidents. Although the cost of installing these doors
makes their presence across the railway network unlikely in the near
future, their potential for significantly reducing the number of
injuries or deaths on the tracks should be considered when planning
future network renovation or expansion.

Other proposed interventions include increasing the presence of drainage
pits, as mortality at London Underground stations that have a drainage
pit was 44% *v*. 76% at those stations without, in incidents of
individuals falling or jumping in front of trains.\ :sup:`(n.d.ah)`
These drainage pits were originally constructed to drain water between
the tracks in deep-tunnel stations. Installation of blue lights at
platforms was put forward as an effective measure by Matsubayashi *et
al* in 2013\ :sup:`(n.d.ai)` but this benefit was minimised by Ichikawa
*et al* the following year.\ :sup:`(n.d.aj)` Another suggested measure
is reducing the average speed of trains entering the station at peak
times.\ :sup:`(n.d.ac)` In Vienna, changing the way in which media
reported suicides on the underground by making it less dramatic was
followed by a reduction in suicide.\ :sup:`(n.d.g)`

.. _S8:

Strengths and limitations
-------------------------

This is the most recent study looking at patterns of suicide on the
London Underground since 1994. It is also the first study looking at
ethnicity within incidents of death by suicide on the Underground, and
the findings raise new and important dimensions when seeking to
introduce preventive measures.

There were several limitations to the study: no data were available for
deaths by suicide between 2000 and 2003 owing to changes in coding, and
death by suicide could not be confirmed in 47 cases owing to the
recording of an open verdict or the outcome of the inquest not being
available. Because of the relatively rare occurrence of deaths by
suicide on the London Underground the numbers used in the study were
small, leading to possible sample size bias. The limited breadth of
information collected by the British Transport Police meant that certain
risk factors (e.g. use of drugs/alcohol or whether individuals were
psychiatric in-patients at the time of the event) could not be
adequately explored in our sample. The study is further limited by the
absence of data beyond 2010.

.. _S9:

Conclusions
-----------

Suicide on the London Underground railway system continues to be an
important public health issue. The widening gap between the number of
recorded suicide attempts and deaths by suicide is encouraging and may
reflect the introduction of preventive measures. Use of PSDs has been
proven to be effective for both suicidal acts and accidental ‘person
under train’ incidents and needs to be considered when planning railway
renovation or construction projects. The overrepresentation of people of
White Northern European ethnicity among those who attempted suicide
requires further exploration, as does the proportion of non-residents
involved in suicide attempts on the London Underground across the year
to better target preventive interventions. Finally, the collection of
data on alcohol and drug use, as well as a more detailed psychiatric
history, would help to inform further research and implementation of
preventive measures for suicidal acts on the London Underground.
