  **Aims and method** The mean delay for bipolar disorder diagnosis is
  10 years. Identification of patients with previous hypomania is
  challenging, sometimes resulting in misdiagnosis. The aims of this
  study were: (a) to estimate the proportion of primary care patients
  with depression currently taking antidepressants who have undiagnosed
  bipolar disorder and (b) to compare a brief 3-item manic features
  questionnaire with the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-13). The sample
  comprised patients with a recorded diagnosis of depression, either on
  long-term antidepressant therapy or with previous multiple courses of
  antidepressants.

  **Results** Of 149 participants assessed, 24 (16.1%) satisfied
  criteria for bipolar disorder. Areas under the curve (AUC) for the
  3-item questionnaire and the HCL-13 were similar (0.79 and 0.72,
  respectively) but positive predictive values (PPV) were low.

  **Clinical implications** Bipolar disorder may be underdiagnosed in
  primary care. A 3-item questionnaire could be used by general
  practitioners to screen for bipolar disorder in their patients with
  depression.

title: Evaluation of the 13-item Hypomania Checklist and a brief 3-item
  manic features questionnaire in primary care
---

Bipolar disorder affects at least 1--2% of the population and is
associated with considerable psychosocial impairment.^1--4^ Accurate
diagnosis can be difficult because patients tend initially to present in
primary care for help with depression rather than with manic features,
and many primary care practitioners do not systematically assess for a
history of bipolar disorder.^5--7^ Recently the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended that all patients in the
UK presenting to primary care with depression should be assessed for a
history of manic features, specifically 'previous periods of
overactivity or disinhibited behaviour'.^8^

Recent screening studies of bipolar disorder in UK primary care have
identified that between 7 and 10% of individuals with depression may
have undiagnosed bipolar disorder, usually bipolar disorder type
II.^9,10^ It is also the case that individuals with difficult to treat
depression and those with poor response to antidepressants are more
likely to have unrecognised bipolar disorder.^11^

In this context, we aimed to estimate unrecognised bipolar disorder
within a sample of primary care patients with depression who were taking
antidepressant medications, as well as to evaluate the potential
clinical utility of two short screening questionnaires for bipolar
disorder: the 13-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-13)^12^ and a brief
3-item manic features questionnaire. Our focus on these brief assessment
instruments was stimulated by the need for questionnaires that could be
used easily in primary care consultations, which are usually no longer
than 10--15 min.

# Method {#S1}

## Sample {#S2}

Practice managers of 9 primary care practices in the west of Scotland
identified from their databases 2633 patients who (a) had a recorded
diagnosis of depression and (b) were either currently taking long-term
antidepressants (more than 12 months) or had had 3 or more courses of
antidepressants in the past 5 years. Then, 1860 potentially eligible
patients were reviewed by their general practitioner (GP) for
eligibility and 1833 written invitations were sent by post, with
participant information sheets, on behalf of the research team. There
were 204 people who responded to this invitation and 151 were
interviewed, giving a response rate of 8.23%. The study was approved by
the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (reference: 13/WS/0071
18th, approval letter dated April 2013).

## Assessment measures {#S3}

A research nurse completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DMS-IV
(SCID-1)^13^ in person in order to obtain a gold-standard diagnosis. An
assessment of practice notes was also conducted to corroborate findings
from the SCID-1 assessment and to clarify medication regimens.
Participants completed the HCL-13 and a brief 3-item bipolar screening
questionnaire. This 3-item questionnaire (with a maximum score of 6) was
based on the three core diagnostic features for bipolar disorder taken
from DSM-5: elevated mood, severe irritability and overactivity.^14^ The
questions and scoring were as follows: Have you ever had a period of
time when you were feeling so good, 'high', excited or 'hyper' that
other people thought you were not your normal self or you were so
'hyper' that you got into trouble? (Definitely no (score 0), perhaps yes
(score 1), definitely yes (score 2).)What about a period of time when
you were so irritable that you found yourself shouting at people or
starting fights or arguments? (Definitely no (score 0), perhaps yes
(score 1), definitely yes (score 2).)What about a period of time when
you were physically much more active than usual, for example, when you
had lots of different projects on the go at the same time? (Definitely
no (score 0), perhaps yes (score 1), definitely yes (score 2).)

## Analyses {#S4}

Analyses included the Student\'s *t*-test, chi-squared test and
chi-squared test for association, and were conducted using SPSS version
21 for Windows. To assess the likely clinical usefulness of the HCL-13
and 3-item questionnaires, in terms of differentiating between bipolar
disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD), we calculated sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive
value (NPV) using MedCalc and verified these manually. Positive and
negative clinical utility measures were calculated using an online
calculator constructed by the developer of the MedCalc test
([www.psycho-oncology.info/cui.html](www.psycho-oncology.info/cui.html)).^15^

# Results {#S5}

Of those who had a full diagnostic assessment, two participants were
excluded because their SCID results suggested a primary diagnosis of
alcohol-related mood problems. In total, 24 participants from our final
sample of *n* = 149 had a DMS-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder (16.1%;
95% CI 10.8--23.2%) and the remainder had a diagnosis of MDD (*n* = 125,
83.9%).

There were no significant differences between the bipolar disorder group
and the MDD group in terms of age, gender distribution and socioeconomic
status (assessed using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, SIMD)
([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). However, as expected, the bipolar
disorder group had higher mean scores on the HCL-13 (9.21 *v*. 6.61,
*P*= 0.001) and on the 3-item questionnaire (4.79 *v*. 2.88, *P\<*
0.001).

## ROC analyses {#S6}

The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves in [Fig.
1](#F1){ref-type="fig"} demonstrate that both the HCL-13 and the 3-item
questionnaire performed well in terms of differentiating between MDD
(*n* = 125) and bipolar disorder (*n* = 24). For the HCL-13, an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI 0.61--0.84) demonstrates a 'fair'
overall ability of the questionnaire to discriminate effectively between
the two groups. Similarly, an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.69--0.89) for the
3-item questionnaire also demonstrates a 'fair' overall ability. An AUC
of over 0.80 is considered to demonstrate a 'good' overall ability to
discriminate.^16^

[Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"} presents the sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, NPV and likelihood ratio analyses. For the HCL-13, a threshold
score of 8 points had a sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 55.28%
but PPV was low at 24.66%. At a higher threshold of 9 points, the
sensitivity was 70.83%, specificity was 63.41%, PPV was 27.42% and NPV
was 91.76%. At the lower threshold of 7 points, the sensitivity was
79.17%, specificity was 52.03%, PPV was 24.36% and NPV was 92.75%.
Therefore, a threshold of 4 points was chosen to give the best balance
between different statistical parameters.

HCL-13, 13-item Hypomania Checklist; NPV, negative predictive value;
PPV, positive predictive value.
:::

Similarly, a threshold score of 4 on the 3-item questionnaire had a
sensitivity of 83.33%, specificity of 64.23% and PPV of only 31.25%. At
a higher threshold of 5 points, the sensitivity was 66.67%, specificity
was 78.05%, PPV was 37.21% and NPV was 92.31%. At a lower threshold of 3
points, sensitivity was 91.67%, specificity was 43.09%, PPV was 23.91%
and NPV was 93.36%. Therefore, a threshold of 4 points was chosen to
give the best balance between these different parameters.

The positive clinical utility -- the ability of the test to confirm
cases of bipolar disorder -- was poor for both tests. The negative
clinical utility a measure of screening and excluding bipolar disorder,
was slightly better for the 3-item questionnaire than the HCL-13 at our
threshold values: 0.611 (95% CI 0.541--0.682) compared with 0.582
(0.509--0.655). These thresholds were chosen to give the best balance
between sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and positive and negative
clinical utility

# Discussion {#S7}

One of the goals of this study was to estimate how common DMS-IV bipolar
disorders might be in a sample of primary care patients taking
antidepressant medication, specifically those patients who were either
taking antidepressant therapy for more than 12 months or who had had
multiple courses of antidepressants over the preceding 5 years. We found
that 16.1% of our sample had bipolar disorder. This rate is higher than
in previous literature from the UK. In samples of primary care patients,
Hughes *et al*^10^ found a prevalence of 7.3% whereas Smith *et al*
found a prevalence of 9.6%. Both studies assessed patients with
depressive disorder who had been prescribed antidepressant medication.
It is possible that the addition in our study of participants who had
previously been prescribed multiple courses of antidepressants led to a
higher prevalence estimate for bipolar disorder, because unrecognised
bipolar disorder is more common in patients with more severe and
enduring depression.^17^

We also aimed to compare the HCL-13 and a brief 3-item questionnaire in
terms of their ability to differentiate between patients with MDD and
bipolar disorder. We found that the AUC for HCL-13 was 0.72, while for
the 3-item questionnaire it was slightly higher, at 0.79. For both tests
the ability to discriminate between MDD and bipolar disorder in terms of
sensitivity and specificity was reasonable, but PPVs were low. This is a
function of the low prevalence of bipolar disorder in primary care
setting, but represents a potential limitation in terms of the
usefulness of these instruments to GPs in everyday clinical
practice.^18^ In a review of brief screening instruments for depressive
disorder in a low-income country, Hanlon *et al*^19^ concluded that the
low PPV at acceptable sensitivity levels may preclude their use in
clinical settings.

Nevertheless, we would argue that there may be some use in primary care
for these brief screening instruments alongside additional assessments,
for example whether patients have a strong family history of mood
disorder. The 3-item questionnaire in particular may be useful to GPs in
terms of fulfilling the NICE requirement to assess all patients with
depression for a history of manic features. The high NPV of 95% means
that clinicians may find this useful for excluding a diagnosis of
bipolar disorder in their patients with depression. The NICE guidance
states that the ideal instrument should be brief, easy to administer and
to score, and should be able to be interpreted without extensive and
specialist training ^8^

## Strengths and limitations {#S8}

This was a reasonably large study that took a systematic approach to
screening patients in primary care settings. We used definitions of
bipolar disorder and MDD based on formal diagnostic classifications by
using SCID assessment. The study included a range of people from
different social backgrounds, with the majority living in some of the
most deprived areas of Scotland. However, it may have been helpful to
have more baseline demographic information on patients, such as
ethnicity, family history of bipolar disorder and age at onset of
depression, and the study may be subject to recall bias because it
relied on the patient\'s recall of prior episodes of manic symptoms
rather than a corroborative history. There may also be an issue of
selection bias, because GPs were able to exclude certain participants if
they felt that they were not suitable for this study As a result of
this, and the fact that only one method of recruitment was used in this
study, there was a relatively small final sample given the number of
invitations sent, which may have led to ascertainment bias. Moreover,
the SCID interviewer was not masked to HCL-13 and 3-item scores, which
may also have been a source of bias.

Another potential limitation is that the 3-item questionnaire had no
requirement for a minimum duration of symptoms. It is possible that
individuals with brief periods of affective instability, such as those
with borderline personality disorder, would be inclined to respond
positively to these questions. Similarly, we did not take a history of
alcohol or drug use, and while we did exclude alcohol or
substance-induced mood disorders, the use of psychoactive substances
could have led to false positives with the 3-item questionnaire.

## Clinical implications {#S9}

A brief 3-item questionnaire may be clinically useful for GPs who wish
to screen for manic features in patients with MDD. This could prompt
more detailed assessment, such as an appointment with a relative or
friend to obtain a collateral history before assessing the need for a
referral to secondary care. Further studies are required in larger
samples to assess the clinical usefulness of this test in screening,
ideally without the issues of recruitment faced in this study It may
also be helpful to develop the 3-item questionnaire further, perhaps
with the addition of other items such as the duration of symptoms. While
the addition of items would lead to a more statistically sound test, it
would also take longer to administer such a test, which may make it less
clinically useful.

A proportion of primary care patients with MDD, perhaps as many as 1 in
5, may have undiagnosed bipolar disorder. For busy clinicians working in
a time-restricted environment, we suggest that a brief 3-item
questionnaire may be a useful screening tool for bipolar disorder and a
first step towards a more comprehensive assessment.
