  **Aims and method** Media portrayals of mental illness have long been
  recognised as being misleading and stigmatising. Following the
  campaigns of several advocacy groups to address this issue, we aimed
  to evaluate the impact on mental health reporting over time. We
  repeated a survey we did 15 years ago using the same methods. Nine UK
  daily newspapers were surveyed over a 4-week period and coded with a
  schema to analyse the reporting of mental health compared with
  physical health.

  **Results** In total, 963 articles -- 200 on mental health and 763 on
  physical health -- were identified. Over half of the articles on
  mental health were negative in tone: 18.5% indicated an association
  with violence compared with 0.3% of articles on physical health.
  However, there were more quotes from patients with mental disorders
  than physical disorders (22.5% *v.* 19.7%) and an equal mention of
  treatment and rehabilitation.

  **Clinical implications** Mental health in print media remains tainted
  by themes of violence, however some improvement in reporting in recent
  years is evident, in particular by providing a voice for people with
  mental illness.

title: Newspaper depictions of mental and physical health
---

Newspapers and other forms of mass media are influential in transmitting
key information and ideas, including social commentary.^1,2^
Consequently, their role in reporting on mental illness is seen as one
of the main conduits through which the public, especially those without
personal exposure to mental illness, learn and come into contact with
issues surrounding mental health.^3,4^

For many years it has been recognised that media reporting of mental
illness is heavily biased in representing a misleading link between
mental illness and violence, with preferential reporting for
sensationalist stories depicting individuals with mental disorders as
being aggressive, dangerous and unpredictable.^1,4--7^ Such widespread
negative portrayals have reinforced the continued stigmatisation and
lack of acceptance among those with psychiatric diagnoses, possibly
increasing social distance and contributing to morbidity and distress.
Of particular concern is the potential 'internalisation' of prejudices
portrayed by the media, such that people with mental illnesses also
begin to take on the view that they are dangerous and unstable.^8^
Furthermore, there is a corresponding lack of voice for people of mental
illness,^6,8^ with few personal accounts of their burden of disease and
similarly little representation from qualified healthcare
professionals.^6,9^ All of this contributes to creating a stereotyped,
isolated group without social status and acceptance.^10^

In a similar vein, there is a disappointing lack of coverage of stories
on recovery and rehabilitation following mental illness.^5,6^ This
potentially leads both the public and policy makers to erroneously
believe that recovery is rare. We highlighted this in a newspaper survey
15 years ago in which we found that the reporting of mental illness and
people with mental illness tended to be negative, whereas that of
physical illness was much more likely to be positive in tone.^11^ This
may even influence health resource allocations to conditions that have a
higher perceived chance of cure.^4^

As far back as the 1960s, Nunally noted that mental health
representations in media were few and distorted, limited to 'neurotic
behaviour' in evening dramas where 'the afflicted person often enters
the scene staring glassy-eyed, with his mouth widely agape, mumbling
incoherent phrases or laughing uncontrollably'.^12^ Steadman &
Cocozza^13^ also showed that media depictions are often skewed towards
extremes. Their findings on public perception of the 'criminally insane'
(mentally disordered offenders) are salient, with 61% of the public
surveyed responding that they feared former mentally disordered
offenders 'a lot'.^13^ However, as the authors noted, the mentally
disordered offenders named by the public following intensive coverage
tend not to have any legal claim to be 'criminally insane', and are
merely assumed to be as such by the media.

Although those with mental illness are reportedly 2--6 times more likely
to commit violence than matched controls,^5,14^ the National
Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental
Illness^15^ found that only 5% of the homicides carried out in the
general population between 2001 and 2011 were by those with an abnormal
mental state (*n* = 52). However, an additional 14% had been in contact
with mental health services in the preceding 12 months. Therefore, the
vast majority of perpetrators of homicide do not have a mental illness
at the time of the offence (*n* = 951). Contrast this with the
statistics for suicide in the same report: 30% of all completed suicides
in the 10-year period analysed were by patients already known to mental
health services (*n* = 2678). The figures identified are 14 times higher
than for homicide. From this, it is reasonable to infer that an
individual with a mental health disorder is far more likely to self-harm
than harm others. This important point is also often missing from media
reports seeking to capitalise on the sensationalist angle and, by doing
so, dehumanise the patient to the extent that they are defined by their
illness. Similarly, it is clear that people with mental illness are much
more likely to be 'victims' of crime than perpetrators.^16,17^ This
discrepancy in public perception between perpetrator and victim among
those with mental illness has also been highlighted in other
studies,^18,19^ acknowledging the need to shift attention away from the
perceived threat to the public, to providing support and protection for
the truly vulnerable. In this regard, the media has been
counterproductive in reinforcing misleading stereotypes about public
safety while simultaneously underreporting key statistics on mental
health.

Although viral campaigns such as Rethink Mental Illness' 'Find Mike'^20^
have been highly successful in bringing mental illness to some public
attention, it is difficult to assess their impact. Based on our previous
survey,^11^ we hypothesised that: mental health reporting would still be
consistently more negative in tone compared with reporting of physical
health issues, and patients would be consistently underrepresented in
media depictions compared with physical health reports. Additionally,
regarding the link with violence and criminality, we further
hypothesised that the association between mental illness and violence
would continue to pervade mental health reporting.

# Method {#S1}

The method followed that of Lawrie.^11^ Nine weekday UK daily newspapers
(Scottish editions) were surveyed over a period of 4 weeks between 4
March and 4 April 2014. The papers chosen represent a selection of
popular broadsheet (*The Times, The Telegraph, The Independent, The
Guardian, The Scotsman, The Herald*) and tabloid (*Daily Mail, The Sun,
Daily Record*) publications in the UK, with a reported range in
circulation of between 64 279 (*The Independent*) and 2 048 977 (*The
Sun*) in February 2014^21^ Only national newspapers were included in
this analysis, as they have the widest distribution.

Print copies of the newspapers were obtained from the Reference Library
of Edinburgh on the day of publication and manually screened for
headlines relating to mental health or psychiatry and general health
issues. Two tabloids, *The Sun* and *Daily Record*, were purchased each
day, as they were not subscribed to by library services, yet have the
highest circulation figures in the UK.

Articles relating to mental health and physical health were identified
initially through headline screening. The main body of text was then
read and coded as positive, negative or neutral, if the article was
mainly stating facts or had mixed elements. As such, it is possible to
have a disparity between tone of headline and article. Each article was
then analysed and coded to a schema with eight variables, which noted
key themes ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}).

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria {#S2}

The sports and business sections were surveyed, however property and
automobile inserts were excluded due to likely lack of relevance.
Primary newspaper articles, editorials and opinion pieces were included
in the data collection. Advertisements, letters to the editor, film and
entertainment reviews and obituaries were omitted. Articles with only a
passing or chance reference to mental or physical health were also
omitted.

All articles concerning mental disorders recognised by the DSM-5,^22^
psychiatry or psychiatrists were included, as well as generic, undefined
mental conditions with the exception of paedophilia and the paraphilias,
as their classification as a mental illness in DSM-5 is controversial.
For physical health, all articles relating to other general medical
issues were collected. Articles concerning the National Health Service
(NHS) or other organisational bodies were included only if there was a
demonstrable mention of impact on patient health and safety.

# Results {#S3}

In total, 963 health-related articles were collected during the 4-week
period. Of these, 763 (79.2%) concerned physical health, whereas 200
(20.8%) were about mental health. Although there was a slight
preponderance towards neutral pieces (38.0%) in the physical health
category, compared with positive (28.6%) and negative (32.9%) reporting,
the majority of articles concerning mental health were negative in tone
(50.5%), with only a small number of positive (22.0%) or neutral
articles (27.5%) ([Box 1](#box1){ref-type="boxed-text"}). This striking
disparity between mental and physical health reporting underscores a key
finding that mental health reporting remains consistently more negative
than physical health, which is in line with the results from
Lawrie\'s^11^ study over a decade previously (ratio of positive to
negative articles for physical health: 218/251; and for mental health:
44/101; odds ratio (OR) 1.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34--2.97).
In addition, we found a prominent and stigmatising association between
mental illness and violence as 18.5% of mental health articles featured
violence as a major theme, compared with 0.3% of physical health
articles (OR = 86.37, 95% CI 20.60--362.1) ([Table
2](#T2){ref-type="table"}).

Although previous studies have shown that patients with mental illness
are underrepresented in newspaper articles,^6,8^ we found this not to be
the case, with a higher proportion of quotes from patients with mental
illness, their relatives or mental health charities (22.5%) compared
with physical health (19.7%) (ratio of quotes in physical health:
150/613; mental health: 45/155; OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.58--1.23). There
appears to be comparatively fewer quotes from professionals in relation
to mental health however, highlighting the need of the psychiatric
profession to make a conscious effort to engage with the media, and vice
versa.^23^ Interestingly, whereas previous studies have highlighted a
lack of reporting on treatment and rehabilitation for mental
health,^4--6^ here we found the rates to be comparable to that of
physical health articles (24.0% *v.* 28.4% respectively) and previous
reports.^6^

The disorders most commonly associated with violence were personality
disorders as well as undefined 'mental illnesses' and post-traumatic
stress disorder, which make up 13.5% of all articles pertaining to
mental health. Surprisingly, sensationalist stories about schizophrenia
were minimal and comparable to reporting on other mental disorders,
whereas dementia and eating disorders were least likely to be reported
as associated with violence ([Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}).

disorder.
:::

Based on the previous data that show people with mental illnesses are
more likely to be victims of crime rather than perpetrators, we were
interested to see whether this correlated with media reports. We found
that people with mental illness are twice as likely to be portrayed as a
perpetrator (34/200) compared with a victim (17/200), in direct contrast
to the available data.^16,18,19,24^

Given that 18.5% of articles on mental health concern violent acts and
are seen as a threat to the public, we asked what made up the rest of
the negative reporting. On further analysis, it appears that a
significant proportion of the negative articles pertain to the
stigmatisation and abuse of people with mental health within society, as
well as lack of funding and adequate care provision. Examples include
headlines such as: 'The great mental health betrayal' (*The
Independent*, 13 March 2014), an article about the unlawful detaining of
people with mental health illnesses in care homes and hospitals, and
'Mental health and race -- the blight of dual discrimination' (*The
Guardian*, 26 March 2014), which highlights the additional burden of
being an ethnic minority with mental illness. The remainder of the
negative articles are reports on suicide (15.5%).

Overall, there was no significant difference between mental health
reporting in broadsheets compared with tabloids.

# Discussion {#S12}

We found that mental health reporting makes up a fifth of all articles
concerning health in a selection of UK print media over the course of a
month. This is lower than found in a similar study by Pieters *et
al*^25^ in Belgium but comparable to the figures obtained by Lawrie in
the UK^11^ over a decade ago, reflecting little change in the frequency
of reporting on mental health. Half of all articles on mental health are
negative in tone, which is a much greater proportion than for physical
health, but nonetheless represents a small reduction compared with
Lawrie\'s study. On the other hand, the association with violence
remains prominent, with 18.5% of articles carrying a theme of danger or
criminality.

In the intervening 15 years, several campaigns by mental health
charities both in the UK and abroad have sought to lessen the stigma
attached to mental illness and encourage open dialogue about mental
health. Media coverage is important to the success of such campaigns in
influencing public opinion and increasing exposure. In light of this, we
asked whether there is any evidence that media reporting on mental
illness is improving (see below). Although previous studies have
commented on the lack of voice for people with mental illness, we have
found this not to be the case with a higher proportion of quotes from
patients with mental illnesses compared with physical health. Although
there are fewer representations of healthcare professionals in
psychiatry, this may reflect reluctance among the profession as a whole
to engage with the media, as psychiatrists too are affected by
stigma.^26,27^

## Mental illness and violence {#S13}

The link between mental illness and violence is unfortunately still
pervasively reported -- being part of about a fifth of all articles on
mental health. The figure obtained in this study (18.5%) is lower than
previous reports of association with violence.^6^ However, other studies
have utilised more restricted search criteria, only using specific
keywords such as 'schizo', 'mental', 'deranged' and 'psycho', which does
not encompass the whole spectrum of mental illnesses.^5,6,28,29^ As most
studies also used a computerised database programme (such as the
LexisNexis) to generate articles, limiting the search criteria to only
the above keywords will bias the results to find articles on
schizophrenia or those that include derogatory terms such as 'psycho' or
'deranged', which are inherently stigmatic and more likely to be
associated with violence.^29^ In contrast, mental illnesses not usually
considered violent, such as eating and mood disorders, would be excluded
from the analysis.

In our study we found that schizophrenia and psychotic disorders make up
a minority (5%) of reporting on mental illness and only 1.5% of these
articles featured violence. Although there is little contention that
mental disorders are disproportionately associated with violence in the
media, one possible explanation for the strength of the association
between the two is that it is an artefact created by selective searching
among newspaper databases. We suggest the effect would be diluted if all
articles on psychiatry, including conditions such as mood and anxiety
disorders, were incorporated in the analysis.^30,31^

In this study, we also found that people with mental disorders are twice
as likely to be portrayed as a perpetrator of crime compared with a
victim. This is another illustration of how the media can be misleading
on key facts. Education for journalists and guidance on the reporting of
mental health issues is central to bringing about a change in reporting
trends. However, this may be easier said than done. One study attempted
to correct journalists\' erroneous views about mental illness with a
short presentation on schizophrenia prior to a press conference
regarding a high-profile assault carried out by a man with a serious
mental illness. Although they found that journalists had a good recall
for the details several weeks later, the presentation did not ultimately
affect the writing of the article.^32^ This suggests that collaborations
with the media will have a greater chance of success and change in
reporting if they are mutually beneficial and desired. One example of
this is UK mental health charity, Mind, which has set up a series of
media awards for responsible and ethical reporting of mental health
issues
([www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/mind-media-awards](www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/mind-media-awards)),
as well as reporting guidelines for different conditions.^33,34^

## Strengths and limitations {#S14}

The main strength of the study is that all papers were hand-searched
according to the criteria set out in the Method. This abolishes the need
to search based on keywords, potentially increasing the yield of
articles. Similarly, the scope and definition of 'mental illness' is
wider than in previous studies, allowing for a greater overview of the
subject in media. In the current study, the use of one investigator to
locate and rate the articles, is both a potential advantage -- in
reducing interrater variability -- but also a disadvantage in that no
interrater reliability could be established (although we did discuss and
resolve any uncertainties between the authors). The main limitation is
that the coding schema used is a relatively blunt tool and cannot convey
the complexity or depth of a newspaper story. Second, the categorisation
of articles into mental and physical health does not allow for overlap
in coverage, although that only occurred in a small minority of
articles. Furthermore, the short time frame of the study means it can
only provide a snapshot of mental health reporting in the UK. Last,
there were two mental health stories that garnered a considerable amount
of media attention in this time period and subsequently have the ability
to bias the data. One was the suicide of a famous fashion designer and
another, the death of a woman who had murdered her three children and
was subsequently labelled as having a personality disorder. Both stories
were extensively reported on over multiple days. However, they were
included in the analysis as this study was designed to encompass all the
news on mental health over 4 consecutive weeks, rather than the sampling
of random time points, and different reports had different foci as new
information about the cases came to light.

## Conclusions {#S15}

Despite several prominent government-led and charity campaigns, mental
illness and individuals with mental illness continue to experience
stigmatisation and stereotyping. Although it is encouraging that people
with mental disorders are being increasingly represented in print media,
and there appears to be an overall increase in non-stigmatising
articles,^35^ much remains to be done to address the inaccurate and
stigmatising association with violence, and raise the profile of mental
illness as a whole.

The particular reasons for the ongoing negative headlines about mental
illness, and what could or should be done about them, are beyond the
scope of this study. Our results do however indicate that that there is
a clear need for more reporting about mental health in general, and for
more accurate reporting about violence and for more accounts of
innovative research developments in particular. We therefore suggest
that there is much to be gained from further ongoing engagement between
patients and psychiatrists and the media, with an emphasis on realistic
depictions of the lives patients lead and of recent research advances.
