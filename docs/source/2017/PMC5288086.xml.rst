:Abstract:
   **Aims and method** We aimed to audit the documentation of
   decision-making capacity (DMC) assessments by our liaison psychiatry
   service against the legal criteria set out in the Mental Capacity Act
   2005. We audited 3 months split over a 2-year period occurring
   before, during and after an educational intervention to staff.

   **Results** There were 21 assessments of DMC in month 1 (6.9% of all
   referrals), 27 (9.7%) in month 16, and 24 (6.6%) in month 21. Only
   during the intervention (month 16) did any meet our gold-standard
   (*n* = 2). Severity of consequences of the decision (odds ratio (OR)
   24.4) and not agreeing to the intervention (OR = 21.8) were highly
   likely to result in lacking DMC.

   **Clinical implications** Our audit demonstrated that DMC assessments
   were infrequent and poorly documented, with no effect of our legally
   focused educational intervention demonstrated. Our findings of
   factors associated with the outcome of the assessment of DMC confirm
   the anecdotal beliefs in this area. Clinicians and service leads need
   to carefully consider how to make the legal model of DMC more
   meaningful to clinicians when striving to improve documentation of
   DMC assessments.

All doctors are often required to make assessments of their patients'
decision-making capacity (DMC). This role is prominent in liaison
psychiatry services, as psychiatrists may be asked to provide a second
opinion on DMC for other medical specialties (e.g. regarding consent for
a surgical procedure). In the UK, psychiatric second opinion tends to be
requested following refusal of treatment by a patient, :sup:`1` but also
when the assessment is likely to be highly complex or is driven by an
underlying psychiatric disorder. :sup:`1, 2` DMC is also routinely
assessed in the UK in psychiatric patients in emergency settings such as
accident and emergency (A&E) departments. At the time of the audit
guidance by the Care Quality Commission :sup:`3` recommended that
assessments regarding DMC to consent to treatment and admission should
be made on all patients at the point of admission to a psychiatric
hospital to clarify whether it was an admission authorised through the
consent of a patient with DMC or under the ‘best interests’ procedures
in a patient who is assenting but lacking DMC.

In England and Wales the legal criteria through which DMC is assessed
are provided by the Mental Capacity Act 2005, with further guidance in
its Code of Practice. :sup:`4` Under the Act, for a person to lack DMC
evidence is required that they suffer from ‘an impairment of, or a
disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain’ (Section 2(1)),
and that as a consequence of this they are unable to perform at least
one of the following tasks: ‘(a) to understand the information relevant
to the decision, (b) to retain that information, (c) to use or weigh
that information as part of the process of making the decision, or (d)
to communicate [their] decision’ (Section 3(1)). DMC is ‘decision
specific’ rather than a ‘blanket’ or global ability: it is tailored to
the specific decision at hand and recognises that different factors may
influence different decisions.

There are additional considerations during the assessment of DMC, in
that the assessor must also take heed of the principles of the Mental
Capacity Act 2005 which include that ‘A person must be assumed to have
capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity’ and ‘A person
is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable
steps to help him to do so have been taken without success’ (Section 1).
Recently the House of Lords Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act
2005 heavily criticised the implementation of the Act: ‘Our evidence
suggests that capacity is not always assumed when it should be. Capacity
assessments are not often carried out; when they are, the quality is
often poor. […] The presumption of capacity, in particular, is widely
misunderstood by those involved in care’. :sup:`5`

We know that patients lacking DMC to consent to treatment are common in
both general medical in-patient (around 40%) :sup:`6` and psychiatric
in-patient settings (around 60%). :sup:`7` An assessment and decision
regarding DMC has significant repercussions for the patient, either
respecting autonomy or paving the way to surrogate decision-making under
‘best interests’. It is therefore important to document clear
justification for a decision reached, under the statutory criteria of
the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Previous work in the USA has shown poor
documentation of DMC in a retrospective study of in-patient lumbar
punctures authorised by a surrogate decision-maker (3 patients had DMC
documented out of 25 procedures authorised by a surrogate, although in
21 cases there was enough information to ‘infer’ lack of DMC). :sup:`8`

Our aim was to audit the documentation of DMC assessments provided by
our liaison psychiatry service against the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and
its Code of Practice, and the guidance issued by contemporary
literature. :sup:`9` Subsequently, we employed an educational
intervention in our service to see whether this improved documentation
of the assessments. We collected detailed information on the factors
influencing the assessment of DMC to see whether this had an impact on
the quality of DMC assessment or of the intervention.

Method
======

All new referrals received by the King's College Hospital Liaison
Psychiatry Team, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM),
during the month of November 2011 were collated. The team is split into
the accident and emergency team and the general in-patient team covering
all referrals. In working hours there are also specialist child and
adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), older adults, neuropsychiatry
and perinatal psychiatry teams. All referrals outside of working hours
are taken on by the general service. CAMHS referrals were excluded from
this audit.

Assessments of DMC performed by members of the team are completed
without a formal template or form and were documented in the SLaM
electronic medical record (EMR) as free text. All patient contacts by
the team need to be recorded in the SLaM EMR.

The EMR was searched for documentation of assessments of DMC by
searching for the word ‘capacity’ and any statement declaring that the
patient had or lacked DMC was taken to be an assessment of DMC. The
entire duration of the patient episode related to that referral was
audited. Statements that suggested the patient may or may not have DMC
but that did not make formal declaration were taken by this audit to be
an assessment of DMC. The exception to this were statements that
suggested the person may lack DMC, but that formal assessment could be
delayed.

We set our gold-standard to require documentation of: (1) justification
of the timing of the assessment/attempts to maximise DMC in accordance
with the principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and; (2) the full
statutory criteria of DMC (presence or absence of a disorder of ‘mind or
brain’, and performance on the four key abilities). We excluded the need
for an explicit statement linking psychopathological features of the
disorder of ‘mind or brain’ to any deficit found in the four key
abilities given that some patients were found to not have a disorder of
‘mind or brain’.

Further information was gathered, including: basic demographic
information, whether the assessment took place in or out of hours, the
decision for which DMC is being assessed, the professional background of
the assessor, and whether the person agreed or objected to the
intervention/option proposed. The severity of potential consequences to
the patient regarding refusal of the intervention for which DMC was
assessed was also quantified, and classed as mild, medium and severe
risk of adverse outcome (by a psychiatrist with experience of DMC
assessments and patient management in this clinical environment). An
example of a severe risk is a refusal of admission into a psychiatric
hospital by a patient with florid psychosis or refusal of
life-sustaining medical treatment; an example of mild risk is a refusal
to contact relatives for information-sharing regarding the patient's
clinical episode.

Following the audit in November 2011 (month 1), we analysed the initial
results. Given that none had met our gold-standard (see below), we
designed an educational intervention to improve clinicians'
understanding of the legal framework of the assessment of DMC and how to
document this appropriately. The intervention took place during the week
psychiatrists in training (senior house officers (SHOs)) change jobs
(February 2013, month 16), and continued for the following 4 weeks. It
involved the lead auditor (B.S.) meeting with the medical (SHO) and
nursing (psychiatric liaison nurses (PLNs)) members of the liaison team
and explaining the gold-standard of DMC documentation; presenting this
to the on-call SHOs during their induction as they may cover the team
out of hours; and emailing the SHO cohort and the senior doctors on call
(specialist registrars (SpRs)) on a weekly basis with the guidance.
Posters with the guidance were put up in the departmental offices seen
by the PLNs and SHOs.

The 4-week period in February 2013 (month 16) during which the
intervention was applied was audited, along with the month of July 2013
(month 21), using the methods described above. This audit was reviewed
and approved by the trust Psychological Medicine Audit Committee in
January 2012.

   Some patients had more than one DMC assessment. There were no
   significant differences between months.

None met the gold-standard in months 1 or 21, however, 2 (7.4%) did
during the intervention in month 16 (`Table 1 <#T1>`__) and both of
these assessments were performed by the SHOs who had received the
educational intervention. Results were similar when using our lower
standard of documentation of the full statutory criteria: *n* = 2 (9.5%)
in month 1, *n* = 6 (22.2%) in month 16 and *n* = 2 (8.3%) in month 21.
The majority of those failing this standard missed out several elements;
only 3 (4.2%) assessments missed reaching the standard through missing
only one of the four key abilities, whereas 38 (52.8%) assessments
documented none of the four key abilities. We therefore cannot conclude
the educational intervention had any impact at all.

Where recorded, we looked at how frequently the key abilities to be
tested were lacking in people who lacked DMC. Lacking the ability to
‘use or weigh’ information was most common (*n* = 19, 73.1% where
recorded), followed by ‘understanding’ (*n* = 10, 43.5% where recorded),
‘retaining’ (*n* = 8, 57.1% where recorded) and ‘communication’ (*n* =
4, 33.3% where recorded).

The majority of assessments of DMC were performed by doctors (*n* = 51
(70.8%) *v. n* = 21 (29.2%) assessments performed by the PLNs). Of the
PLNs' assessments only 3 (14.3%) patients were found to lack DMC,
whereas of the doctors' assessments 33 (64.7%) patients lacked DMC
(`Table 2 <#T2>`__). PLN assessment was significantly more likely to
result in a positive DMC than a doctor assessment (OR = 11.0, 95% CI 2.9
to 42.5). The doctors met the gold-standard (*n* = 2, 4%) and full
statutory criteria (*n* = 9, 18%) more often than the PLNs (*n* = 0 and
*n* = 1, 5% respectively).

   DMC, decision-making capacity; PLN, psychiatric liaison nurse.

We separated the types of decisions to be made by the patient into those
that involved ‘psychiatric admission or treatment’ and ‘medical
admission or treatment’. For the purposes of the audit, decisions to
start a new admission in hospital or discharge oneself from a current
admission were seen as interchangeable. Medical and psychiatric
decisions were not mutually exclusive and a proportion of patients were
assessed for both. There were assessments of DMC that did not focus on
these decisions, but they were a minority and focused on decisions not
normally tested in this setting, such as DMC to make a decision around
ongoing homelessness (*n* = 1) and ongoing abusive relationship/domestic
abuse (*n* = 2). These non-treatment-focused assessments of DMC all
occurred as part of the psychiatric assessment by a PLN or doctor rather
than following a request for second opinion from the medical teams.

We found that the proportion of assessments of DMC for medical admission
or treatment formed the majority of assessment at the start of the audit
month 1 (*n* = 17, 81%), but this reduced over the course of the audit
in month 16 (*n* = 12, 44%) and month 21 (*n* = 8, 33%; Pearson's
χ\ :sup:`2` = 9.91, *P* = 0.007) (`Table 3 <#T3>`__). Conversely,
assessments for psychiatric admission or treatment were the minority at
the start of the audit (*n* = 5, 24%) and increased in month 16 (*n* =
13, 48%) and month 21 (*n* = 13, 54%), although the differences were not
statistically significant.

We separated the choices of people who were having their DMC assessed
into agreeing with the intervention proposed by the assessor/medical
team and objecting/unable to express a choice/unknown. Fewer people were
assessed who agreed with the intervention in month 1 (*n* = 5, 24%), but
in months 16 and 21 they made up half of those assessed (`Table
3 <#T3>`__). Agreement with the intervention was strongly associated
with a finding of DMC: 26 (81%) of those agreeing with the intervention
were found to have DMC, compared with only 10 (25%) of those who did not
agree (either objecting or otherwise) (`Table 4 <#T4>`__). This was
highly statistically significant (Pearson's χ\ :sup:`2` = 22.50,
*P*\ <0.001). Most assessments made by the PLNs were done in patients
agreeing to the intervention (*n* = 15, 71%), contrary to doctor
assessments (*n* = 17, 33%).

   DMC, decision-making capacity.

   Pearson's χ\ :sup:`2` = 22.50, *P*\ <0.001.

A logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of the
assessor (PLN or doctor), agreement with the intervention and
consequences of the decision. Initial models also included decision to
be made and underlying mental disorder, however, these were removed from
the final model as they had no effect.

The final regression model was statistically significant (Pearson's
χ\ :sup:`2` = 45.81, *P*\ <0.001). The model explained 64.7% of the
variance (Nagelkerke R\ :sup:`2`) and correctly classified 81.2% of the
outcome of the assessments of DMC.

Factors associated with the finding of lack of DMC were: more severe
consequences of the decision (OR = 24.4, 95% CI 3.47 to 171.8), not
agreeing with the intervention (OR = 21.8, 95% CI 4.0 to 118.8), and
assessment by doctor rather than PLN (OR = 14.9, 95% CI 2.1 to 104.5).

Discussion
==========

We have shown evidence that documentation of 72 DMC assessments in 3
sampling months in a liaison setting was poor, with only 2 assessments
reaching our gold-standard. The impact of a legal education intervention
was very limited and was not sustained beyond the month in which it was
applied.

There are several possible reasons as to why the proportion of
assessments meeting our gold-standard was so low, even after the
educational intervention. Clearly, a lack of documentation of all
components of the assessment of DMC does not necessarily equate to these
components not having been considered by the clinician assessing DMC.
However, there is limited documentary justification of the nature of the
clinical assessment and the legal model of DMC. Perhaps elements of the
education intervention itself (design, style, length etc.) may not have
been an effective means of conveying the information, although our audit
was not designed to evaluate this. The explicit reference to the
principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in our gold-standard might
have set the standard too high, but even our more lenient ‘full
statutory criteria standard’ was only achieved in 13.9% of assessments
during the course of the audit.

Where lies the difficulty in translation of the legal model to clinical
assessments? In situations where evidence is presented to the Court of
Protection (the civil court in England and Wales with the jurisdiction
for cases in which an individual lacks DMC), the Court requires
completion of prescribed forms that demand a level of evidence similar
to our gold-standard. In a busy clinical environment it is easy to see
how documentation of the presence or absence of DMC could be considered
to be sufficient by clinicians. A process that might slow the system
down (or be perceived as such) can be expected to be powerfully
resisted.

It is interesting that the assessments of DMC by PLNs result more often
in the patient being concluded to have decision-making capacity. This
finding needs to be approached with caution given that DMC assessments
were triggered by several different reasons in our audit, including
either: (1) a second opinion assessment of DMC, usually in the context
of a patient refusing treatment, in which the assessment would be
performed by a doctor; or (2) an assessment of DMC in the context of
admission to psychiatric hospital performed by any clinician.

As doctors performed all second opinions of DMC assessment, usually in
the context of a patient refusing treatment, and they assess all
patients who will need compulsory admission to hospital, there is a
referral bias. The majority of DMC assessments performed by the PLNs
were in the context of a patient agreeing with the suggested
intervention, and hence were used to support the clinical assessment. If
there is no dispute around the intervention offered, then DMC assessment
has little consequence and it is easier to presume DMC.

The strong association between lack of DMC, high severity of outcome,
refusal and lack of assent is striking. To our knowledge this is the
first piece of work that has clearly demonstrated this association in
real clinical practice. It would seem to suggest that clinicians when
assessing DMC in practice use an outcome test of DMC rather than the
functional test the law requires. Kim *et al* :sup:`10` have shown that
assessments of DMC by clinicians using video simulations of consent
discussions around involvement in research are risk sensitive. This
echoes early work on conceptualising DMC as necessarily risk sensitive.
:sup:`2` Owen *et al* :sup:`11` reported an association between
treatment refusal and DMC assessed using the MacArthur Competency
Assessment Tool for Treatment. Although the association is striking, we
consider it to be largely expected, given the selection bias that
assessments of DMC performed as a second opinion by our service are
normally prompted by treatment refusal in the context of a possible
mental disorder, when refusal is likely to result in significant harm to
the patient. It is reassuring that there are a proportion of assessments
where people are found to have DMC despite the refusal and high severity
of consequences, and we submit that this is evidence of careful clinical
consideration of each case on its own merits.

Our audit has shown that there are limitations in the recording of
assessments of DMC, and that uptake of an educational intervention was
limited. We consider that this is likely due to the perceived disconnect
between the legal assessment and clinical assessment. We would recommend
that the next step in the audit cycle should include an educational
intervention on the assessment of DMC with a formal evaluation, with
exploration and focus on clinical factors and their relationship to
legal criteria in order to be more acceptable for clinicians.

In conclusion, we have found evidence for the anecdotal belief on the
impact of severity of consequences and agreement status of the patient
on the outcome on their assessment of DMC. Reassuringly, these factors
were not totally deterministic of the outcome but they do suggest that,
in practice, the functional test of DMC is yet to fully bed down.

We would like to thank Dr Lisa Conlan for her support and advice during
the audit process.
