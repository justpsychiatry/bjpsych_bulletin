  **Aims and method** We aimed to evaluate the availability and nature
  of services for people affected by personality disorder in England by
  conducting a survey of English National Health Service (NHS) mental
  health trusts and independent organisations.

  **Results** In England, 84% of organisations reported having at least
  one dedicated personality disorder service. This represents a fivefold
  increase compared with a 2002 survey. However, only 55% of
  organisations reported that patients had equal access across
  localities to these dedicated services. Dedicated services commonly
  had good levels of service use and carer involvement, and engagement
  in education, research and training. However, a wider
  multidisciplinary team and a greater number of biopsychosocial
  interventions were available through generic services.

  **Clinical implications** There has been a substantial increase in
  service provision for people affected by personality disorder, but
  continued variability in the availability of services is apparent and
  it remains unclear whether quality of care has improved.

title: "Personality disorder services in England: findings from a
  national survey"
---

Personality disorder is a serious mental health condition affecting up
to 52% of psychiatric out-patients and 70% of in-patients and forensic
patients.^1--4^ Given the significant public health implications
associated with the disorder -- including extensive use of healthcare
resources, high rates of suicide and reduced life expectancy --
effective treatment is a priority.^5--8^

In 2003, the National Institute for Mental Health England (NIMHE)
published *Personality Disorder: No Longer a Diagnosis of Exclusion*,
challenging the healthcare community to address shortcomings in the
treatment of people with personality disorders.^9^ Citing a survey of
English mental health trusts conducted in 2002, the paper brought to
attention the variability in practice and highlighted institutionalised
stigmatisation which explicitly barred patients with personality
disorder from mainstream services. At that time, only 17% of trusts had
a dedicated personality disorder service, 40% provided some level of
service, 28% had no identified service, and 25% did not respond.^9^

The 2003 NIMHE publication^9^ set out broad principles for how
personality disorder services should be developed, stipulating that they
should be multidisciplinary, follow a hub-and-spoke model, accept the
management of risk, use the care programme approach (CPA),^10^ offer
specialist biopsychosocial interventions, deliver training and
consultation, and support the development of patient networks.
Similarly, the 2009 guidance on borderline personality disorder from the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) specified that
mental health trusts should develop specialist multidisciplinary teams
and/or services for people with personality disorders.^11,12^ In 2011, a
preliminary investigation at a regional level found that specialist
service capacity for those with personality disorder was inadequate.^13^
There have been no systematic attempts at a national scale aimed at
understanding how the evidence for the management of personality
disorder is being applied or whether service availability has become
more uniform.

In 2014, the National Personality Disorder Service Review Group was
formed to evaluate the extent to which variable service availability
affects those with personality disorder. The group used the vision of
*Personality Disorder: No Longer a Diagnosis of Exclusion* as its
benchmark. Through this lens, we sought to map the availability and
nature of dedicated personality disorder services, and to compare these
to the care for clients with personality disorder available through
generic services. The group drew on a wide range of evidence to define
the concept of a 'dedicated personality disorder service'. This included
the Delphi study of the 11 pilot personality disorder projects within
the National Personality Disorder Programme.^14^ We considered a
dedicated service as one which is explicitly designed to manage the care
of individuals affected by personality disorder, as opposed to a generic
service which might be considered a typical community mental health
service. [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} displays the characteristics
hypothesised by the group to distinguish dedicated from generic
services.

# Aims {#S1}

The primary aim of this study was to describe a number of organisations
which provided care for those affected by personality disorder and
whether this care was delivered through dedicated personality disorder
services, generic services or both.

The secondary aim was to evaluate the provision of services for
personality disorder along key quality indicators outlined by NICE and
NIMHE,^9,11,12^ and explore any differences between dedicated and
generic services. The quality indicators evaluated were: Is there a
multidisciplinary team available?Is care managed under the CPA
process?Are patients offered specific interventions for personality
disorder within a biopsychosocial approach?Are services involved in
education, training and research?What level of patient and carer
involvement do services employ?What exclusion criteria, if any, are
applied by services?

# Method {#S2}

## Survey design {#S3}

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of mental health organisations in
England using a questionnaire designed for this study. Data were
collected between January and June 2015 using an online survey tool
([www.surveymonkey.com](www.surveymonkey.com)).

## Sample {#S4}

The sample included any English mental health National Health Service
(NHS) trust or independent provider of mental healthcare to adults or
young people. In 2015 there were 57 relevant English mental health NHS
trusts and 10 independent service providers, all of whom were approached
to participate in the survey.

## Procedure {#S5}

Letters were sent to the medical directors of each NHS mental health
trust and the CEOs of the independent providers informing them of the
survey and requesting the name of the individual who they considered to
have the requisite knowledge to complete the survey. Once details of
these individuals were obtained, letters were sent inviting them to take
part. Non-responders were followed up at least twice where necessary,
offering further information or support to complete the survey
questionnaire.

## Survey questionnaire {#S6}

Following an analysis of available literature, the electronic survey was
structured to address the primary and secondary aims of the project.
Participants were asked to briefly describe their organisation (e.g. NHS
or independent provider, geographical remit) and their own professional
role. They were then given a brief definition of a dedicated personality
disorder service and of a generic service and asked to indicate whether
their organisation had services of each type and detailed questions
about its characteristics. We requested details of a maximum of five
dedicated personality disorder services per organisation.

Questions relating to service characteristics included service
leadership, team make-up, service access, inclusion and exclusion
criteria, care management framework, intervention availability, patient
and carer involvement, and training, education and research activity.
The survey took up to 45 minutes to complete and could be conducted
electronically or with telephone support.

## Data analysis {#S7}

Data were downloaded from Survey Monkey and entered initially into Excel
for checking and data cleaning, and transferred to STATA (version 11)
for statistical analysis. To address the primary aim of the survey, the
characteristics of services were summarised descriptively in order to
build a picture of service availability and characteristics. The
availability of biopsychosocial interventions was assessed by generating
a score ranging from 0 to 100 based on the number of available
interventions of each type, weighted to give equal consideration to each
of the three domains. The availability of personality disorder-specific
interventions was assessed by determining whether services offered
psychological therapies developed specifically for personality
disorder.^15^ The level of perceived patient and carer involvement was
similarly analysed and scored from 0 to 100 based on the number of
involvement activities for each service, with paid involvement double
weighted.

To address the secondary aims of the survey, logistic and linear
regression was used to evaluate the effect of service type (dedicated or
generic) on professional diversity, exclusion criteria, CPA usage,
biopsychosocial provision, patient and carer involvement, and training,
education and research activity. Multilevel models, with a random effect
for organisation, were used to adjust for the potential higher
similarity between services within the same organisation than between
services from different organisations. Robust standard errors were used
for linear variables that did not conform to a normal distribution.
Where significant differences between dedicated and generic services
were found, multivariate models were used to adjust for the influence of
potentially confounding service characteristics.

# Results {#S8}

## Respondents {#S9}

Of the 57 relevant English mental health NHS trusts, 52 responded
(response rate 91%) and of the 10 independent service providers
approached 4 responded (response rate 40%).

## Primary study aim: availability of services for people with personality disorder {#S10}

Of the 56 organisations that responded to the survey, 47 (84%) reported
having at least one dedicated personality disorder service and 43 (77%)
reported having both generic and dedicated services. The remaining 4
organisations (7%) stated that they did not have any generic services
and that all services were specialist; all offered dedicated personality
disorder services. Nine organisations (16%) did not have any dedicated
personality disorder services, and all of these stated that their
generic services catered to personality disorder. Patients were reported
to have equal access to dedicated personality disorder services in 31
(55%) of the organisations surveyed.

The number of dedicated personality disorder services per organisation
ranged from 1 to 5 (mean 1.7, s.d. = 1.1). Across the 52 English mental
health NHS trusts, 71 dedicated personality disorder services and 48
generic services were described, a mean of 1.37 dedicated service per
organisation (range 0--5). The four independent service providers
described ten dedicated personality disorder services; a mean of 2.50
dedicated service per organisation (range 1--5). [Figure
1](#F1){ref-type="fig"} compares the findings with the survey of 2002.
To aid comparison, the independent sector organisations have been
removed from the 2015 results so that only English NHS mental health
trusts are referred to. Tables [2](#T2){ref-type="table"},

characteristics of the dedicated and generic services across all domains
surveyed.

## Secondary study aims: quality indicators of available services {#S11}

### 1. Is there a multidisciplinary team available? {#S12}

Across services, teams varied widely in their multi-disciplinary
composition ([Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}). Within services, team
make-up was significantly less diverse in dedicated than in generic
services, with the latter utilising almost twice as many different types
of professional on average (dedicated personality disorder services mean
5.7, s.d. = 3.0; generic services mean 10.5, s.d. = 5.1 (β = −4.85, 95%
CI −6.37 to −3.32, *P* \< 0.01)). Dedicated services remained less
professionally diverse than generic services after adjusting for the
range of biopsychosocial interventions available, the provision of
personality disorder-specific interventions, and the profession of the
service lead (β = −3.14, 95% CI −4.46 to −1.82, *P* \< 0.01). This
suggests that the less diverse workforce in dedicated services was not
simply due to providing a more focused range of interventions.

### 2. Is care managed under the CPA process? {#S13}

Almost all services used the CPA as their management framework. There
was no difference between dedicated and generic services in CPA usage
(odds ratio (OR) = 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.47, *P* = 0.12).

### 3. Are patients offered specific interventions for personality disorder within a biopsychosocial approach? {#S14}

Across services, there was a fairly wide availability of a number of
different biological, psychological and social interventions. [Table
3](#T3){ref-type="table"} includes the mean biopsychosocial ratings
stratified by service type. Generic services had significantly higher
biopsychosocial ratings than dedicated ones, indicating a greater
availability and diversity of interventions (β = 3.02, 95% CI 2.32 to
3.73, *P* \< 0.01). However, services led by medics offered a greater
range of interventions than those led by other professionals (β = 1.09,
95% CI 0.97 to 2.84, *P* \< 0.01), as did services with a more diverse
professional make-up (β = 0.38, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.45, *P* \< 0.01).
Biopsychosocial intervention provision did not differ between dedicated
and generic services after adjusting for these factors (β = 0.69, 95% CI
−0.29 to 1.68, *P* = 0.17). Contrary to hypothesis, the availability of
interventions developed specifically for personality disorder (such as
dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), mentalisation-based therapy (MBT),
schema-focused therapy (SFT) and systems training for emotional
predictability and problem solving (STEPPS)) did not differ
significantly between dedicated and generic services (OR = 0.91, 95% CI
0.37 to 2.21, *P* = 0.83).

### 4. Are services involved in education, training and research? {#S15}

Most services were involved in at least one of these activities ([Table
4](#T4){ref-type="table"}). The rates of participation in these
activities for dedicated services were approximately twice those of
generic services, and dedicated services were significantly more likely
than generic services to be involved in all three of these activities
(i.e. education, training and research) (OR = 6.18, 95% CI 2.29 to
16.69, *P* \< 0.01). This difference remained significant after
adjusting for the profession of the service lead and for the
professional diversity of the team (OR = 31.67, 95% CI 4.26 to 235.5,
*P* \< 0.01).

### 5. What level of patient and carer involvement do services employ? {#S16}

[Table 5](#T5){ref-type="table"} contains the mean patient and carer
ratings stratified by service type. Very few services had no patient or
carer involvement, and the odds of having any involvement activity did
not differ between dedicated and generic services (OR = 1.17, 95% CI
0.42 to 3.22, *P* = 0.77). However, dedicated services had significantly
higher patient and carer involvement ratings than generic ones,
indicating involvement in a greater number of service development, care
planning, service delivery, training and leadership activities (β =
6.29, 95% CI 3.03 to 9.55, *P* \< 0.01). This difference remained
significant after adjusting for the profession of the service lead and
for the professional diversity of the team (β = 9.76, 95% CI 3.90 to
15.62, *P* \< 0.01).

### 6. What exclusion criteria, if any, are applied by services? {#S17}

No services excluded individuals on the basis of a diagnosis of
personality disorder. Across both dedicated and generic services, the
most common exclusion criterion was uncontrolled substance misuse,
followed by active risk to others ([Table 6](#T6){ref-type="table"}).
Almost half of services (43%) had no exclusion criteria. Dedicated
services were significantly more likely than generic ones to have
exclusion criteria (OR = 10.95, 95% CI 3.31 to 36.19, *P* \< 0.01). This
difference remained significant after adjusting for the profession of
the service lead and for the professional diversity of the team (OR =
5.02, 95% CI 1.24 to 20.35, *P* = 0.02).

# Discussion {#S18}

This national survey was the first of its kind and captured data
provided by 56 relevant mental health organisations in England. With a
response rate of 91% for English mental health NHS trusts, and a sample
of independent service providers, we can be confident the survey is
representative of personality disorder provision in England.

The majority of organisations described both dedicated personality
disorder services (84%) and generic services (91%), and in organisations
with no dedicated services all provision for personality disorder was
through a generic service. This quantifies the progress made in this
area since 2002 and points to a fivefold increase in organisations
providing dedicated personality disorder services.^9^

This represents substantial progress in a decade in which the economic
landscape has been challenging. Yet, while on this measure we can see
substantial progress at an organisational level, the survey indicates a
worrying level of variability at a local level, with only 55% (*n* = 31)
of organisations indicating equal access to the dedicated services they
provide.

The 2003 NIMHE publication formally introduced the concept of dedicated
personality disorder service as distinguished from generic service, and
this distinction has been further developed in the current paper.^9^ We
had *a priori* assumptions about the nature of dedicated and generic
services ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}), and this survey allows a
more detailed conceptual analysis. The survey methodology steered
respondents to consider the concept of dedicated *v*. generic services.
Analysis of the descriptive and statistical differences between the 81
dedicated and 51 generic services allows us to draw some conclusions
about these two types of service provision. For instance, we found that
generic services draw from a wide range of professional disciplines,
which is in line with their broader remit. Seemingly, dedicated services
draw from a more restricted range of professional disciplines; this
supports the notion that they are specialist, niche services.

Contrary to our *a priori* hypothesis, dedicated services were no more
likely to provide personality disorder-specific interventions when
compared with generic services. Furthermore, generic services provide a
significantly wider range of biopsychosocial interventions than
dedicated ones, although there was some suggestion that this was
influenced by their employment of a significantly more diverse workforce
and by their higher rates of medical professional leadership. The
accessibility of these interventions and the quality of their delivery
are unknown; however, NICE guidance stipulates that specialist
interventions are best delivered by specialist services.^11^

The delivery of developmental activities is a clear priority for
dedicated services, with almost all involved in training, and
significantly more dedicated than generic services involved, indicating
that they deliver both training and education and research. This is in
keeping with both the 2003 NIMHE publication and NICE guidance.^9,11,12^
Patient and carer involvement is also prioritised by dedicated services,
with patients and carers involved in significantly more service
development, management and delivery activities than those in generic
services. Dedicated services appear to show greater selectivity in
patient choice than generic ones, as significantly more operate with
exclusion criteria. Given that impulsivity is a diagnostic criterion for
borderline and dissocial personality disorder, it is noteworthy that
active risk to others (23%) and substance misuse (53%) were so widely
quoted as exclusion criteria for dedicated personality disorder
services.

## Limitations {#S19}

The response rate for the independent providers should be treated with
caution as it is subject to selection bias. Responses were self-reported
and there may have been variation in the interpretation of what
constituted a dedicated personality disorder service.

In the comparisons made with generic services, the respondents were
asked to provide an overview of all of the generic services within their
organisation. Although this was pragmatically necessary, given the large
numbers of generic services within any organisation, this approach
requires the reader to consider the comparisons with appropriate
caution. In particular, the findings which relate to the personality
disorder-specific interventions and range of staff within the
multidisciplinary team will be skewed by this methodology.

While this survey is able to give a good organisational-level
description of service availability, mapping the local provision is
achieved to a limited degree. Perhaps the most important consideration
is that the indicators used in this survey to consider the quality can
only provide a broad brush-stroke indication, owing to necessary
methodological trade-offs for pragmatic purposes.

Understanding the consistency with which individual patients and carers
can expect adherence to best practice and the timeliness of the
interventions offered is beyond the scope of this survey. We believe
this body of work begins to elucidate the questions which need to be
considered, but it is a long way from achieving that. Indeed, the
largest limitation of this work is that at best it provides a broad
overview of provision. To properly understand what is actually delivered
to those in need will require a more systematic and sustained effort to
describe quality standards and ensure, perhaps through accreditation,
that best practice is being followed.

## Further developments {#S20}

This paper charts the most systematic attempt to date at mapping the
provision of care across England for those affected by personality
disorder. What is clear is that the past decade or so has seen
considerable progress in providing a service for this range of
disorders. Despite this progress, data presented here provide evidence
that there remains continued exclusion, variability of practice and
inconsistencies in the availability of services.

The current NICE guidance, in step with the evidence base, supports the
provision of a range of cost-effective interventions and the
establishment of specialist services from which to deliver them. The
initial offering presented here lends weight to the call for the
establishment of authoritative commissioning guidance and service
standards to ensure that patients and carers have access to the care
that they need.

The National Personality Disorder Service Review Group work stream was
seeded by a small project funding initiative through the Royal College
of Psychiatrists\' Faculty of General Adult Psychiatry in 2014 and West
London Mental Health Trust Research and Development. A multidisciplinary
group was formed with representations from psychiatry, psychology,
psychotherapy and expertise through lived experience of personality
disorder. At various stages through the project the affiliates included:
the Faculty of General Adult Psychiatry, West London Mental Health Trust
Research and Development, Informed Thinking, The Medway Engagement Group
and Network (MEGAN) and the Imperial College Centre for Mental Health.
The project was granted approval as a service evaluation through the
audit department of West London Mental Health Trust.
