These standards require child and adolescent eating disorder services to begin out-patient treatment within 1 week for urgent cases and 4 weeks for non-urgent cases. However, neither the standards nor monitoring are in place for adults, and the much-awaited funding into community eating disorder services has not yet reached the front line. Adult in-patient eating disorder services are part of specialist services and have been commissioned by NHS England. Over the past few years, NHS England has initiated a shift of commissioning to regional NHS collaborations, with the intention of transformation of care pathways focusing on the health of local populations, with the aim of improving outcomes and cost-savings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" disp-level="2" id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>In this paper, we describe demand and capacity for hospital treatment of patients with severe eating disorders in the Healthy Outcomes for People with Eating Disorders (HOPE) provider collaborative in South-East England since July 2018, and examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study has been approved by the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust Audit Department.

It was established in shadow commissioning form in July 2018. The main goal of the network was to bring together in-patient and community services from several organisations providing in-patient and out-patient services for adults with eating disorders. Initially, the network included a total population of 5.2 million.</p><p>The footprint was reduced in September 2019, and the following partners have remained in the provider collaborative: Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust (Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Swindon, Wiltshire), Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Foundation Trust and the Priory Group (in-patient provision in Bristol).</p><p>The total population of the geographical footprint is 3.5&#x000a0;million. Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust provides 14 beds in Oxford, and 6 beds in Marlborough. In addition, Oxford has six day patients and Marlborough has four. Berkshire and Gloucestershire have day services for 8 and 12 patients, respectively. The Bristol Priory is an independent partner in the provider collaborative providing specialist eating disorder beds; however, as it has a national contract with NHS England, their beds are not aligned with the HOPE provider collaborative.</p><p>This provider collaborative has developed a more collaborative and joined-up approach to admissions and discharge planning, with the aim of improving access closer to home and joint working between in-patient and out-patient teams. A weekly joint clinical activity panel consisting of senior clinicians from each organisation and a single point of access for all referrals has been established, to ensure that decisions about admissions are made by highly experienced clinicians. Referrals and outcomes have been systematically monitored since July 2018, for the whole geographical area.</p><p>There was also an agreement to monitor outcomes, and compare the NHS England standard eclectic model of care<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> with a new, integrated stepped-care model using I-CBT-E in Oxford, building on the pioneering work of Dalle Grave et al.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> I-CBT-E offers a single evidence-based psychological model delivered by a multidisciplinary team, starting before admission and continuing across the treatment pathway (40 sessions in total). A detailed I-CBT-E formulation ensures continuity, consistency and a personalised treatment plan.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected capacity as a result of infection control measures across the care pathway. In-patient and out-patient services needed to reduce the number of people in poorly ventilated and crowded buildings. Day services had to be closed because of environmental and staffing challenges. Furthermore, remote working may have caused delays in recognition of deterioration of non-cooperating patients (both in primary and secondary care).</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-2"><title>Demographic and clinical data</title><p>This paper analyses data from the partners who have been part of the provider collaborative since the beginning (Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Berkshire) for the period from July 2018 to 1 April 2021.

However, this is likely to increase further with time, as the in-patient capacity for admission is insufficient, not just within the footprint, but also nationally. The reason for no admission was usually because of the patient refusal and/or ongoing out-patient treatment. Approximately half of these patients were admitted following a second referral.

Out-of-area placements are well-known to cause distress to patients and families, and have been shown to have longer length of stay and poorer outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Most worryingly, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with life-threatening malnutrition had to wait several weeks for admission, and this timescale has increased further since the pandemic, placing patients, staff and provider organisations at risk.</p><p>Although current national-level data by NHS Benchmarking on bed occupancy in hospitals suggest that demand is not dangerously high, this is not an appropriate indicator of how pressured specialist eating disorder services are across the care pathway. Infection control requirements and workforce impact of COVID-19 mean that the majority of NHS services are running at reduced capacity. Many services are struggling with reduced staffing levels resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in specialist eating disorder services, monitoring risks and ensuring patient flow between in-patient, day and out-patient services has become much more challenging in an already pressurised system.</p><p>The physical environment is important to ensure patient and staff safety. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has been campaigning for improving mental health estates and facilities.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This has become even more pressing since the COVID-19 pandemic: improving services to meet increasing demand requires capital investment into NHS mental health services</p><p>Following the high-profile reports into avoidable deaths, there has been an acknowledgement that adult community eating disorder services need to be funded to reach parity across the age range,<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and this is reflected in the new NHS England commissioning guidance for adult eating disorder services. However, this is still aspirational, and many adult patients struggle to access care or face long waiting times. This may explain the high number of patients in our network referred to hospital with a BMI of &#x0003c;13, in a life-threatening emergency, which has increased by 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a concern, as although the Royal College of Psychiatrists published the &#x02018;Management of Really Sick Patients with Anorexia Nervosa&#x02019; (MARSIPAN) guidelines to improve patient safety in emergencies,<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> their implementation has been inconsistent in acute hospitals, as shown by the recently reported tragedies. This is partly because of the limited training of eating disorders for doctors and allied health professionals, an area of concern that was identified by the PHSO.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Although it is possible that the much needed investment into adult community eating disorder services in the next few years will reduce the need for in-patient treatment in the future, this is going to take several years. In-patient provision needs to be increased to meet current demand, which has quadrupled since 2007&#x02013;2008 in England.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, recent national epidemiological data<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> indicate increasing prevalence across the lifespan, and this is consistent with increasing referrals to the community teams and the increasing rates of hospital admissions. NHS-led provider collaboratives will only succeed if funding meets the need in the population served.</p><p>However, it is important to consider the significant variations in length of stay and short-term outcomes between providers. Our findings are consistent with previous research. In 2013, a UK-wide cohort study of adult specialist eating disorder units reported an average length of stay of 182 days and an average discharge BMI of 17.3,<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> with only 22% reaching a BMI of 19 by discharge. In our study, only 16% of patients admitted to a unit offering standard eclectic treatment reached a discharge BMI &#x0003e;19, as opposed to 50% in the I-CBT-E pilot programme (within a 25% shorter length of stay), Discharge BMI is an important predictor of medium- and long-term outcomes.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although this was not a randomised controlled trial, the treatment model is based on a previous randomised controlled trial, and published manuals.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>The findings of the Oxford pilot programme (I-CBT-E) utilising an evidence-based and integrated stepped-care approach suggests that, with service transformation, reduced length of stay, improved patient outcomes and reduced restrictive practices are achievable. This can ensure use of existing limited in-patient capacity more effectively, and suggests a significant opportunity for cost-savings. This is particularly important, as a large proportion of patients in the cohort had an illness duration of &#x0003e;10 years. Our findings replicate previous studies from Italy,<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and suggest that the model is generalisable to the NHS. However, adaptation would require the redesigning of care pathways, staffing levels and skill mix. CBT-E training is freely available online (<uri xlink:href="https://www.cbte.co/for-professionals/training-in-cbt-e/">https://www.cbte.co/for-professionals/training-in-cbt-e/</uri>) and has been tested in previous research.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The main limitations of our study are that we only had BMI as a consistent indicator of outcome at discharge, and that the comparison between in-patient providers was not based on randomisation. However, randomisation would not have been practically possible, given the limited capacity and the dispersal of beds in a wide geographical area in England and Scotland. Further work with our partners will explore more details of the longer-term psychosocial and health economic outcomes.</p><p>A multicentre, randomised controlled trial would be desirable, but it is important to note that the current NHS England standard contract is based on expert opinion rather than trial evidence, or robust outcome monitoring.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-1"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>It has been frequently stated that anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality of any mental disorder affecting young people and adults.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> We should not accept this: people should not die of anorexia nervosa or any eating disorder, as they are treatable mental disorders.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Severe complications, such as malnutrition, are safely reversible, even in the most extreme cases.</p><p>The I-CBT-E model is based on a cohesive, integrated stepped-care approach for people with severe eating disorders, and wider implementation in the NHS has the potential to both improve short-term and long-term outcomes, with the added benefit of cost-savings. A national audit of demand, capacity and treatment outcomes would help to establish the need for specialist eating disorder beds, as well as explore the differences between various treatment models. There is an urgent need for capital investment into NHS mental health facilities to ensure a safe environment for patients and staff in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to all of our partners for submitting the data, Beris Cummings and Este Botha for data collection and Dr Andrew Ayton for proofreading.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Agnes Ayton</bold> is a Consultant Psychiatrist with Cotswold House, Oxford, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>David Viljoen</bold> is a Consultant Clinical Psychologist with Cotswold House Oxford, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Sharon Ryan</bold> is a Quality Improvement Lead with HOPE and CAMHS PC, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Ali Ibrahim</bold> is a Consultant Psychiatrist with the Berkshire Eating Disorder Service, Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Duncan Ford</bold> is a Provider Collaboratives Lead with Thames Valley Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK; and Provider Collaboratives Lead at the HOPE Adult Eating Disorder Provider Collaborative, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="S2056469421000735sup001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><p>For supplementary material accompanying this paper visit http://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2021.73.</p><media xlink:href="S2056469421000735sup001.docx" id="d64e670" position="anchor"><caption><p>click here to view supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec-das1"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, A.A., upon reasonable request.</p></sec><notes id="nts4" notes-type="other"><title>Author contributions</title><p>A.A. and A.I. developed the initial idea.
