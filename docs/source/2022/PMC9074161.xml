As a branch of psychiatry, psychotherapy needs research. Although cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy has been considerably researched, the relationship of psychoanalytic psychotherapy to research is complicated. Within psychiatry and among the public, there are common perceptions of psychoanalytic psychotherapy as unscientific and psychotherapists as uninterested in research.</p><p>Let us begin by outlining the issue: what is the problem regarding research in psychotherapy? There is evidence that psychoanalytic psychotherapy services within the public sector in the UK have been disproportionately reduced compared with other mental health services.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This may be due to a lack of a robust evidence base in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy compared with other modalities, such as cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy. However, high-quality research in psychoanalytic psychotherapy can substantially advance our knowledge of the efficacy of treatment of different mental disorders.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Within the psychoanalytic community a lack of understanding and interest in research persists;<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> this is reinforced by a (real and perceived) split in the community between academics, who do research, and clinicians, who see patients. Many of the trials in psychodynamic psychotherapy have lacked sufficient methodological rigour and do not necessarily reflect real-life practice.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Among psychoanalytic psychotherapists, resistance to research is driven by several factors. Research methods (such as manualisation of treatments, randomisation of patients, recording of sessions, administering outcome measures) are often seen as interfering with clinical technique and practice. Practising therapists may have a poor understanding of the research currency of statistics and numbers and end up finding research activity mindless and meaningless. Moreover, research is treated with suspicion, as it may challenge established and cherished theories.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Nevertheless, there are strong reasons for psychotherapists to engage in research. We need first to investigate the efficacy and outcomes of psychotherapy, to ascertain whether change does occur with treatment, and second to investigate the process of therapy, to understand what happens in therapy and how change occurs. We also need to ensure the safety and quality of treatment and to explore patients&#x02019; experiences of psychotherapy. As for commissioners, patients and the public, their expectation of research engagement and the evidence base for psychotherapy needs to be satisfied. Finally, research is an effective means of interrogating new and existing theories and of communicating with colleagues.</p><p>One should bear in mind that psychiatric practice involves at its heart the use of a therapeutic relationship, and research into aspects of this relationship can reap useful and highly applicable rewards.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The relative sparsity of research in this area reflects the current dominance of the biomedical paradigm within psychiatry. The predominance of cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy, alongside the biomedical paradigm, has played a part in the neglect of psychotherapy research among psychiatrists.</p><p>The Faculty of Medical Psychotherapy of the Royal College of Psychiatrists has a membership consisting of psychiatrists who practise psychotherapy as their main therapy or use its principles in their work, as well as psychiatrists who may not be practising psychotherapy but have an interest in the subject. Among those practising psychotherapy, different modalities of therapy may be used; however, psychoanalytic psychotherapy is the main modality in which the majority of medical psychotherapists have been trained. The Faculty is interested in research and is exploring ways of promoting psychotherapy research.</p><p>In this study, we surveyed our membership, with the aim of describing psychiatrists&#x02019; views on research in psychotherapy and their experiences in engaging with research.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Method</title><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-1"><title>Design</title><p>A web-based survey was designed by the two joint Research Leads (M.F. and T.L.) of the Faculty of Medical Psychotherapy. The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Faculty were consulted in the design of questions and response options. The College Registrar gave approval to the final version of the survey before its distribution to Faculty members. Survey responses were anonymous.</p><p>The survey consisted of 26 questions and covered the following areas:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>general respondent characteristics (member group, current post, work location)</p></list-item><list-item><p>views on the importance of psychotherapy research</p></list-item><list-item><p>ways of learning about psychotherapy research</p></list-item><list-item><p>satisfaction with their own knowledge of psychotherapy research and interest in gaining knowledge</p></list-item><list-item><p>research experience</p></list-item><list-item><p>opportunities for, and obstacles to involvement in, psychotherapy research</p></list-item><list-item><p>views on the Faculty's interest and involvement in research</p></list-item><list-item><p>suggestions to the Faculty regarding promoting psychotherapy research</p></list-item><list-item><p>suggestions to support trainees in psychotherapy research.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The format of the questions varied (Appendix) and some questions asked for additional free-text responses. The survey was written and hosted on SurveyHero and was sent out via email to the entire Faculty membership (3842 UK members and 827 overseas members). The email contained a brief message introducing the survey and the reason for doing it, and a direct link to the survey webpage. The email was sent in August 2019 by the College Faculty and Committee Manager. A reminder email was sent before closure at the end of September 2019.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-2"><title>Participants</title><p>All Faculty members, including psychiatrists at all levels of training and experience, were emailed about the survey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1-3"><title>Analysis</title><p>Only fully completed survey responses were included in the analysis.

There was a high level of research experience or qualification among the survey respondents &#x02013; almost half held a research degree, one-third had held a paid research post and 97% had engaged in some kind of research activity.</p><p>Given the low response rate to the survey, these findings cannot be taken as representative of the membership of the Faculty in general. Nevertheless, the survey highlights the existence of a group of members within the Faculty who are interested and engaged in research, and gives an indication of how the Faculty can play a part in this area. Despite the high prevalence of research qualifications and experience, only a minority of respondents had current opportunities for involvement in research, and the majority perceived obstacles to engaging in psychotherapy research. This points to an untapped potential and resource for psychotherapy research and begs the question of what one can or should do with it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our survey is the first of its kind for the Faculty and addresses an important issue for training and development in medical psychotherapy. The questions were designed to extract relevant background data, views and experiences that can inform the Faculty's strategy. The entire Faculty membership was surveyed and the low response rate means that the findings cannot be regarded as representative of the Faculty membership at large. The Faculty has a large number of quiescent members and this is also a factor in the low response rate. To put this in context, there were only 269 doctors with medical psychotherapy (or psychotherapy) as their specialty listed on the General Medical Council specialist register in 2019.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This indicates that we had 42/269 (16%) of specialty-listed medical psychotherapists responding in this survey. Many of these doctors may not be working in designated psychotherapy posts or be practising psychotherapy. The number of doctors in postgraduate training in medical psychotherapy in the UK in the same year was 37. This indicates we had 14/37 (38%) of medical psychotherapy trainees responding.</p><p>One expects that members who are more research-inclined were more likely to take time to respond to the survey, thus biasing the results towards a more pro-research direction (i.e. viewing research as more important and having greater experience and interest in research) than would be found across the membership in general. Likewise, the views on research opportunities or lack thereof, and desire for more Faculty engagement with research, cannot be generalised across the entire membership of the Faculty. The responses may be subject to some degree of bias due to social desirability, although the free-text responses suggested considerable frankness of expressed views. The choice of interventions that the Faculty could deliver to promote research and support trainees in research were based on a pre-determined list of options and may not have covered all possibilities.</p><p>Nevertheless, the survey highlights the presence of a group of research-inclined members in the Faculty and points to ways that these members can be helped to participate more actively in research. Members are keen for the Faculty to facilitate networking. This may mitigate against the sense of isolation and disconnection that individuals may face among local colleagues or within organisations with little interest in psychotherapy research. Networking can take a number of forms &#x02013; for example connecting experts and supervisors with trainees, linking with other faculties (such as the Faculty of Academic Psychiatry), links with established research and funding bodies. Other ideas for the Faculty to implement include featuring articles on research more prominently in newsletters, organising academic activities (e.g. conferences, skills workshops) on research, offering practical guidance on setting up projects, and better access to psychotherapy research journals (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref> lists useful resources on research).

The real and perceived disinterest and even hostility of academic institutions towards psychotherapy research, sometimes combined with negative preconceptions about medical psychotherapy, especially psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy, create a culture that does not consider it possible for medical psychotherapists to engage in research. To an extent, this is reflected in certain deficits in research academic development opportunities for medical psychotherapy. In England, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Integrated Academic Training Programme provides academic opportunities for doctors and dentists in specialty training, through the funding of Academic Clinical Fellowship (ACF) and Clinical Lectureship (CL) posts that support trainees to spend 25% (in the case of ACF) or 50% (CL) of their time in research training over 3 or 4 years. In more than a decade of this programme, no single trainee has been awarded such a post within the specialty of medical psychotherapy.</p><p>There are top-down as well as bottom-up problems to be addressed. The historical lack of research-active senior medical psychotherapists and the absence of medical psychotherapists within academic institutions means that medical psychotherapy has become a non-existent entity in many research circles. Some argue that research should be more embedded in training in medical psychotherapy, in which the prevailing emphasis is on acquiring clinical psychotherapeutic skill; they believe that knowledge of psychotherapy research, routine use of clinical outcomes, and experience in designing and conducting research should all form part of the curriculum for trainees. Among medical psychotherapy trainees, designated time that is meant for research or special interest (such sessions exist for psychiatry trainees of all specialties) is often used instead for further clinical experience or for personal psychotherapy.</p><p>Senior and consultant-level medical psychotherapists in the public sector have faced increasing cuts to sessions and their job plans focus exclusively on clinical service delivery; this approach is short-sighted and deprives medical psychotherapy of possibilities for development. A more beneficial strategy would be to encourage those medical psychotherapists with research experience and interests to pursue projects as part of their job plan, and to provide support where needed to facilitate this. Where a National Health Service (NHS) organisation already has an established partnership with an academic institution, links for psychotherapy research can be set up and formally endorsed by both organisations. Previous research has indicated that, to be willing to participate in research, psychotherapists expected high-quality designs, financial compensation and personal gains.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This indicates the importance of support to therapists at both research and career-progression levels to encourage more participation in research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From the survey, we conclude that there exists a group of members within the Faculty of Medical Psychotherapy who value research and are keen to engage in research activity, and are a resource that ought to be harnessed. Noting the greater level of dissatisfaction with their research involvement among trainees than among consultants, this is a particularly important group to focus resources on. A number of actions recommended by survey respondents are feasible and already being planned, for example establishing research networks, linking trainees with supervisors, conferences and workshops on research, and campaigning for more equitable academic opportunities nationally. Given the role of medical psychotherapists in combining a medical, psychiatric and psychotherapeutic perspective,<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> it is critically important that this unique perspective is brought to bear on the psychotherapy research agenda.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Steve Pearce (Chair of the Faculty of Medical Psychotherapy) for advising on the survey design and Adrian James (Registrar of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) for approving the survey.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Marcella Fok</bold> is a consultant psychiatrist in psychotherapy for the Waterview Centre, a specialist personality disorder service within Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, and a visiting researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, UK. <bold>Tennyson Lee</bold> is clinical lead at Deancross Personality Disorder Service, East London NHS Foundation Trust, and co-director of the Centre for Understanding Personality Disorder (CUSP), London, UK.
