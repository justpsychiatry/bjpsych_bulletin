A recent study found that cardiometabolic risk factors were already pronounced in those presenting to services with a first episode of psychotic illness, and that physical health deteriorated during the first year of treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In light of these apparent contradictions, we aimed to investigate whether physical health has improved among people with psychotic disorders. We conducted a secondary analysis of data gathered over the past 9 years, during national audits of services for people with psychosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><p>All data for this study were collected during two audit rounds conducted as part of the National Clinical Audit of Psychosis (NCAP) by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Both examined services providing care to people with psychotic disorders in England. A &#x02018;core&#x02019; audit generated data on people under the care of community mental health teams (CMHTs), with three rounds of data collection in 2011, 2013 and 2017. A &#x02018;spotlight&#x02019; audit collected additional data on the quality of care received by people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) who received care from early intervention for psychosis (EIP) teams. Three rounds of the spotlight audit were conducted in 2014, 2018 and 2019. All National Health Service (NHS) Provider Trusts in England with CMHTs and EIP teams that provided care to patients with psychotic disorders were invited to take part in these respective audits.</p><p>For both audits, all participating organisations were asked to provide an anonymised list of eligible patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria during a 12-month &#x02018;sampling window&#x02019; before the point of data collection. From each list, 100 patients were randomly selected for inclusion in the audit. For the CMHT audit, patients were eligible for inclusion if they had an active period of care with a participating CMHT, were aged &#x02265;18 years and had an established diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (ICD-10 codes F20/F25) recorded during the 12-month sampling period. Patients were excluded if they had received in-patient care or care from an EIP team during this period. For the EIP audit, patients were eligible for inclusion if they had an active period of care with a participating EIP team, were aged &#x02265;14 years and had a diagnosed &#x02018;first episode&#x02019; of any psychotic disorder (ICD-10 codes F20-F29) recorded during the 12-month sampling period. For the purposes of this study, we excluded any patients whose host organisation did not participate in all three rounds of the respective audit.</p><p>For both audits, staff from each organisation were asked to conduct a retrospective review of case notes from the sampling window, and extract data to complete an online data collection tool. The tool included questions on physical health measures, quantifying patients&#x02019; smoking status, alcohol use, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), serum glucose, serum lipids and whether they were known to use illicit substances. The data collection tools for both audits were based on NICE guidance for management of psychotic disorders.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> They were developed in collaboration with patients and providers of psychiatric services, and carer representatives with lived experience of supporting patients with psychotic disorders. The tool was piloted by six volunteer trusts before the main audit, to ensure that the process was understandable and acceptable.</p><p>During the development of this project, the National Research Ethics Service and the Ethics and Confidentiality Committee of the National Information Governance Board advised that formal ethical approval and individual participants' informed consent were not required because this was a secondary analysis of audit data and patient-identifiable data were not being collected.

This contradicts recent studies where results have been more pessimistic,<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> but would be in line with previous research suggesting a change in the epidemiology of smoking, with a gradual reduction in smoking in younger age groups.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This improvement over time was not reflected in the CMHT audit, where patients were on average significantly older.</p><p>There was also a marked reduction post-2014 in the proportion of patients under the care of EIP services who were using illicit substances. This contrasted with the CMHT audit where the proportion increased slightly over time.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Data were obtained from large, heterogenous samples over a 9-year period: all NHS Trusts in England with CMHT and EIP services that provided care to patients with psychotic disorders were invited to participate in the respective audits. These data therefore represent a variety of different settings, and we would expect that results would be generalisable to similar patient groups across the country. The primary outcome measures we used to assess physical health are universally recognised as clinically important, and the thresholds for good health were based on national standards that have been widely used elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>However, this study does have important limitations. First, this is an observational study and we do not know what caused the changes we observed. Although they may reflect changes in services during this period, other changes in society are affecting population health,<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and these could be responsible for some or all the differences we detected.</p><p>The EIP and CMHT audits were conducted at different times, both before and after the CQUIN framework was implemented, and used different selection criteria. Differences in the physical health of patients between the two are therefore likely to reflect the differing clinical and socioeconomic demographic characteristics of the patients in each audit, as well as different processes of care. We were able to examine changes in physical health over time within each audit, by comparing different rounds. However, as each service provided a random sample of eligible patients at each round, subsequent rounds of the same audit did not necessarily include the same cohort, and so we are unable to make inferences about changes in health at the level of individual patients even within the same audit.</p><p>For both the EIP and CMHT audits, we were able to examine physical health measures before and after the introduction of the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation programme.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Although the introduction of the programme was associated with a marked increase in the proportion of patients who were offered interventions for their physical health,<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> we found only limited evidence that this resulted in changes to the health of people under the care of CMHTs.</p><p>These data were produced from retrospective case note audits at each round, and are therefore dependant on accurate reporting and documentation of events at the time of occurrence. Clinicians working in CMHTs and EIP services may not have had full access to records held by primary care, where some physical health screening may have occurred.</p><p>Also, there were variable amounts of missing data for each primary outcome measure, meaning that the composite measure could only be used for a relatively small proportion of the overall sample. However, the proportion of missing data did generally improve over subsequent rounds of each audit, possibly reflecting the previously noted incentivised improvements in screening rates and recording.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-2"><title>Implications</title><p>We found some evidence that overall health improved for patients with psychotic disorders under the care of EIP services between 2014 and 2019. However, we did not find evidence of a similar improvement for patients under the care of CMHTs between 2011 and 2017.</p><p>This may reflect differences in the model of care implemented by EIP services. Typically, these services advocate a more &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; programme of intervention, with a focus on relatively smaller case-loads, proactive engagement and an increased frequency of contact.<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Although this approach is primarily intended to address psychiatric symptoms, multiple sources have suggested additional benefits for patients&#x02019; overall health, including increased levels of screening for physical health problems.<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> EIP services may, therefore, have been better placed to implement changes resulting from the national initiatives rolled out in 2014.</p><p>However, the difference may also be because of differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients in the CMHT audit and the EIP audit. Patients in the EIP audit were younger on average, and were also likely to have had a shorter duration of psychiatric symptoms (as this audit specifically examined patients with a diagnosed &#x02018;first episode&#x02019; of a psychotic disorder). These patients may have been more accepting of interventions intended to improve their physical health and, therefore, have seen greater improvements &#x02013; even if CMHTs and EIP services had implemented identical changes since 2014.</p><p>It may even be the case that people in younger age groups have become more &#x02018;health conscious&#x02019; in recent years regardless of any intervention, as suggested by some epidemiological studies.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> However, this seems unlikely in these cohorts in light of previous findings that patients on EIP case-loads already had pronounced cardiovascular risk factors, even at the point of first presentation.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Both audits identified some isolated areas of improvement in specific measures. Interestingly, these differed between the patients in the CMHT audit, where there were improvements related to alcohol use, serum glucose level and lipids, and the EIP audit, where there were improvements in alcohol use, smoking and illicit substance use. Again, these changes may relate to demographic differences in the patients under the care of these respective services. Older patients may be more receptive to those that they perceive as reducing their risk of major cardiovascular events, such as reduction in serum glucose and lipids.</p><p>However, these varying improvements may also be because of differences in the treatment approaches adopted by CMHTs and EIP services. These findings merit further research to identify the factors explaining these variations, as well as the improvement in overall good health seen among those treated by EIP services. There may be elements where each service outperforms the other; for example, access to staff with training in physical health interventions, or improved links with primary care. Cohort or case&#x02013;control studies could be used within CMHTs and EIP services to examine what interventions are associated with favourable physical health outcomes at an individual patient level. Qualitative studies to explore the perspectives of patients with psychosis may also identify effective strategies for improving patients&#x02019; physical health. It may also be of interest to include other services, such as assertive outreach teams, in future studies.</p><p>The fact that the EIP audit showed an improvement in rates of illicit substance use over time, but the CMHT audit showed the opposite, is an intriguing finding and of unclear significance. It does not seem to reflect the current understanding of the changing epidemiology of illicit substance use,<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and suggests that EIP services have been able to implement effective measures to support people in abstaining from illicit substances.</p><p>Interestingly, the one measure where both CMHTs and EIP services improved over time was alcohol use. Many drug and alcohol services in the UK are now provided by third-sector organisations rather than NHS mental health teams.<sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The fact that both CMHTs and EIP services were able to effect improvement suggests that effective liaison with external organisations may be a key strategy for improvement, rather than attempting to deliver more services with internal infrastructure, which may already be overstretched.</p><p>Both audits showed specific areas where standards of physical health worsened over time. The findings related to patients&#x02019; weight are particularly concerning: the proportion of patients with a healthy BMI fell significantly across the three rounds of the EIP audit, and was universally low in the CMHT audit. Weight gain is a well-recognised and particular troubling side-effect of many antipsychotic medications.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Given the implications of obesity for subjective well-being, medication adherence and therapeutic outcomes in the context of treatment for psychosis, and associated diabetes and cardiovascular risk and likelihood of premature mortality,<sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> improving interventions in this area needs to remain a focus for researchers. To date, studies of current weight management programmes for people with psychosis have produced mixed results.<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>In addition to these findings, it is also important to note that the majority of patients did not have adequate information recorded for all seven of the physical health measures recommended by nationally agreed standards. Only around half of patients in the EIP audit, and a third of those in the CMHT audit, had usable data recorded for all seven measures. The reasons for this are unclear from this project, and may reflect barriers to physical health screening, such as refusal, lack of provision or inadequate documentation. Clearly, accurate monitoring is required, and will be the focus of quality improvement activities before future rounds of the national audits.</p><p>In conclusion, we found limited evidence that overall health improved for patients with psychotic disorders under the care of CMHTs, following the enactment of national initiatives in 2014, although there was some evidence of improvement in specific areas. There was more substantial evidence of improvements for those patients under the care of EIP services. This may be a result of differences in CMHT and EIP services&#x02019; abilities to implement effective changes in policy and procedures, or demographic and clinical differences in their respective patients. However, these findings merit further research into the processes underlying the improvements in health, to improve the standard of care for people with psychosis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all members of the NCAP team at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, for their support with this study.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Ryan Williams</bold> is an NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow at the Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, UK, and a Clinical Fellow with the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Sagana Natkulasingam</bold> is a medical student at the Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK. <bold>Beatrice Tooke</bold> is an NCAP Programme Manager with the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Ella Webster</bold> is an NCAP Programme Manager with the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Alan Quirk</bold> is Head of Clinical Audit and Research for the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Veenu Gupta</bold> is a Service User Advisor with the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Paul French</bold> is an Honorary Professor with the Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, UK, and an NCAP EIP Clinical Advisor with the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Jo Smith</bold> is Professor of EIP and Psychosis at the School of Allied Health and Community, University of Worcester, UK, and an NCAP EIP Clinical Advisor with the College Centre for Quality Improvement, Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK. <bold>Mike J.
