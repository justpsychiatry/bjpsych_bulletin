:Abstract:
   In mental health services, recovery constitutes a guiding principle
   that is endorsed in professional medical guidelines and has become
   central to mental health policies across the world. However, for many
   clinicians, it can be a challenge to effectively embed recovery
   concepts into professionally directed treatment of disease without
   distortion, and ostensibly away from what matters to those who use
   the services. We discuss the evolving and multifaceted concept of
   ‘recovery’, including illness narratives to frame our discussion. We
   demonstrate how integration between a person-directed management of
   illness and a professionally directed treatment of disease can
   converge, resulting in positive outcomes for people with mental
   illness.

Increasingly, patient-led research has been challenging traditional
professional perceptions on the trajectory and outcomes of mental
illness. (Of note, ‘patient' is the stylistic word choice for this
journal; the authors had submitted ‘service user' in the draft. We
recognise this is an area of discussion and debate). Many people may not
fully recover from mental health problems, but can discover how to cope
with their condition. Evidence has also highlighted that recovery, and
many of the processes involved in it, can happen across a period – in
many cases, outside of formal medical environments. In this editorial,
we summarise and discuss contemporary aspects of recovery, including the
co-concept of ‘illness narratives’. We argue that although recovery can
be a contested topic with differing views, it is also ubiquitous, and
its meanings are not always fully incorporated into truly co-produced
models. Models that put patients’ narratives at the core could perform
as a connecting mechanism that provides a process to take account of
‘personalisation’, which is likely to create a better fit with
individual context, structure and the complex diverse realities of
recovery-oriented practice and routinely provided interventions.

.. _sec1:

Definitions and debate
======================

People outside of the formal health settings understand recovery in
terms of their individual, specific and personal perceptions.
Accordingly Anthony has shown that illness can hinder a person's
perception of a productive life and undermine their process of
recovery.\ :sup:`1` Anthony's work remains highly influential (and
cited) to definitions of recovery, stressing that ‘recovery is what
people with disabilities do, recovery is a truly unifying human
experience’.\ :sup:`1` He also asserts that recovery, is
‘multi-dimensional, defying simplistic measurement’.\ :sup:`1` Other
perspectives on recovery have been explored: Slade has divided these
into two forms, with clinical recovery being defined as symptom changes
viewed by the clinician,\ :sup:`2` and ‘personal recovery’ being defined
as what the individual narrates and understands in a meaningful
way.\ :sup:`2`

What is strikingly obvious here is that recovery is being presented in a
distinct and separated pattern. This separation appears to be divided by
the focus and the lens through which it is viewed. It is questionable
whether this separation is helpful both clinically and furthering the
discourse on recovery itself. The separation pushes apart the idea that
‘professionally directed’ treatment and ‘person-directed’ treatment can
converge; indeed, the spirit of recovery would challenge the language of
this – ‘directed’ inferring ‘being done to a person’ and would call for
it to be more fitfully replaced by ‘perspective’. McWade also reinforces
our view that this concept of recovery can be defined in such a way that
allows freedom to converge medical expertise and affords patients the
autonomy in their individual journey to recovery.\ :sup:`3` Patient
movements have dominated the concept of recovery since the
mid-1970s,\ :sup:`4` and currently there has been criticism of
professionals that look to be trying to ‘mainstream’ recovery concepts
to their advantage.\ :sup:`5,6`

.. _sec1-1:

Research on recovery
--------------------

There has been a significant amount of research and published work
attempting to support each of the individual recovery concepts, but
little has been done on the positive outcomes of converging the
constructs. Recovery research ranges from personal accounts\ :sup:`7` to
attempts to define, standardise or measure the conceptual
framework,\ :sup:`8,9` alongside histories\ :sup:`10` and empirical
studies.\ :sup:`11,12` Recovery-orientated practice guidelines exist for
service provision,\ :sup:`13–18` including an emerging
critique\ :sup:`19` resting on personal recovery,\ :sup:`9,20–22`
recovery-oriented services,\ :sup:`6,23–29` in addition to provider
competencies.\ :sup:`25,30–36` Despite the accumulation of research
produced to support or isolate contested elements of recovery,
disagreement and criticism remains over the definitions of recovery and
on whether recovery has to be survivor-led or a policy
directive.\ :sup:`37`

Narrative and systematic forms of syntheses and reviews have tested
tools\ :sup:`20,22` to incorporate accepted components of
recovery.\ :sup:`34,38` This, however, has only led to further compound
the idea of mainstreaming of recovery.\ :sup:`37` Amid this accumulation
of criticisms, Braslow has shown that ‘recovery is everywhere’ despite
including an array of perspectives.\ :sup:`5` Since the 1990s, the
concept of recovery in mental health domain has affected both the person
experiencing mental health difficulties and the clinicians.\ :sup:`37` A
conceptual framework that acknowledges recovery\ :sup:`33,36` has been
produced by Leamy et al, highlighting five main approaches in their
CHIME framework: Connectedness, Hope – optimism, Identity, Meaning –
purpose, and Empowerment.\ :sup:`38` However, CHIME has not been without
its critics. Bird et al carried out a validation study applying thematic
analysis of data from CHIME, using focus groups with those with
diagnosed schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.\ :sup:`36`
They demonstrated that the CHIME framework was both valid and
appropriate for use, but highlighted areas that were not included, such
as ‘a desire for practical support, issues around diagnosis and
medication, and scepticism about the concept of recovery’.\ :sup:`39` As
noted, evaluating recovery is an inherently complex concept,\ :sup:`40`
challenging the essence of creating ‘reliable measures of individual
recovery’\ :sup:`39` and the construct validity of this. Andresen et al
suggest that if the said concept of recovery is entirely
individual,\ :sup:`41` contrary to ‘what can it be normed and as might
be expected for a concept in which symptom reduction is not paramount’,
then ‘correlations with customary clinical outcome measures may possibly
be poor and convergent validity low’.\ :sup:`42`

.. _sec1-2:

Embracing diversity
-------------------

Given all of this diversity of recovery principles, it is perhaps not
surprising to find professionals misunderstanding and
confused\ :sup:`40,43` in the operational aspects, emphasised in popular
guidelines, discourse, policies and research. Pilgrim aptly suggested
that recovery is a polyvalent concept.\ :sup:`43` However, this does not
translate easily to those who may wish to activate the recovery
construct for better patient outcomes and improved service delivery.
Quiet so, Braslow has argued that recovery remains an ‘unquestioned
overarching principle and popularly known to include a melange of
beliefs, values that materialized because of the intellectual and social
movements’.\ :sup:`5`

Moving to recovery-orientated services
======================================

.. _sec2-1:

An anthropological model
------------------------

To further link back to the discussion on the concept of converging the
person-directed management of illness and professionally directed
treatment, we recognise, similar to Davidson and Roe, that an
anthropological model – one situated upon ‘principles of reciprocity’
that concerns itself more with the integration of healthcare\ :sup:`40`
– could complement and augment professional knowledge.\ :sup:`44`
However, this requires a substantial shift in the clinical lens,
incorporating ‘lay types of knowledge’, such as a person's own
understandings of dealing with illness, including social
functioning.\ :sup:`44` Suitably, Davidson and Roe conceptualise that
meaningful illness narratives are a gift exchange, providing meaning,
emotive steadiness, narration and collective experience.\ :sup:`40`

.. _sec2-2:

Illness narratives and professionals’ treatment
-----------------------------------------------

Biological aspects have often been viewed by patients as both coercive
and impersonal,\ :sup:`45` although we may be seeing some welcomed
change with this, and COVID-19 may offer an interesting corollary, with
the emphasis of ‘long-COVID’ care moving toward wellness and
self-management of long-term chronic difficulties. Pilgrim has pointed
out that the root basis of patients’ adverse perceptions can be based on
pathology, making clinicians appear as ‘chemotherapists with a
prescription pad’.\ :sup:`45`

.. _sec2-3:

The UK and co-production: the Care Programme Approach as an exemplar
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
explicitly calls for care plans to be jointly drawn up between
individuals and their clinician, with shared decision-making and agreed
dates to review its progress.\ :sup:`46` The Care Programme Approach
(CPA) necessitates that health and social needs are comprehensively
assessed and reviewed with individuals with serious mental illness, with
a ‘philosophy of recovery and to foster personalised
care’.\ :sup:`47–49`

Despite their imbedding in contemporary British mental
healthcare,\ :sup:`50` there remains a general lack of data exploring
actual practice in the community, and even less that is focused on
in-patient care.\ :sup:`51` The Healthcare Commission in the UK assessed
in-patient performance across 554 wards in 69 National Health Service
(NHS) Trusts. About 40% were rated as ‘weak’ when it came to including
patients and carers; astonishingly, half of care plans had no evidence
of recording patients’ views, and about a third made no mention as to
whether there was a carer involved. A further third had input from the
patients’ community care coordinators only some or none of the
time.\ :sup:`52`

Work by Simpson et al examined the views and experiences of stakeholders
involved in community mental healthcare, investigating factors related
to the provision of personalised, collaborative, recovery-focused
care.\ :sup:`53` They found substantial variations among sites for
results on therapeutic relationships and participant groups in their
study, related to the experiences of care planning and understandings of
recovery and personalisation.\ :sup:`53` Consequently, carers expressed
varying levels of input, and despite risk assessments being part of
central clinical concerns, they were rarely discussed with
patients.\ :sup:`54`

Patients valued therapeutic relationships with care coordinators and
others, and saw these as central to recovery. However, in another study
by the same team, the staff, patient and carer interviews revealed gaps
between shared aspirations and realities,\ :sup:`55` and staff accounts
of routine collaboration contrasted with patient accounts and care plan
reviews. They also found that personalisation was not a common phrase,
but care was often delivered in an individualised way.\ :sup:`55` McWade
has argued that this endorses that perspective of failure of co-opting
or mainstreaming the ‘thing’ that is recovery.\ :sup:`3`

.. _sec2-4:

Contact with clinicians and patient engagement
----------------------------------------------

‘Illness management’ can be understood as an approach to support
patients with a diagnosis to engage with clinicians, to reduce patient
susceptibility to the disease.\ :sup:`56` Conversely, ‘illness problems’
are the principal difficulties that symptoms and disability create in
lives, and ‘illness behaviour’ then consists of initiating treatment
(for example, changing diet and activities, resting, engaging in
exercise, taking over-the-counter or prescribed medications and deciding
when to seek care from professionals).\ :sup:`57` There is an overdue
lack of understanding placed on the notion that there is a pre-existing
underlying relationship between the person and their illness. Albeit in
separation of formal treatment environments, this occurs in the way
individuals perceive their difficulties, the type of help they envisage,
and the approach they are willing to engage with for formal treatments;
it includes making contact with clinicians and entering into a contract
with services for future treatment.

.. _sec2-5:

The socialisation of the practitioner
-------------------------------------

For the purpose of this editorial, a critical discussion cannot be
complete without including a focus on clinicians understandings.
Hitherto, psychiatric models have perhaps viewed the concepts of
recovery from mental illness in a similar style to how clinicians have
viewed physical illnesses.\ :sup:`58` We propose that Kleinman's illness
narratives model has proved influential in this regard, remarking how
the practitioner has also been socialised into a distinct collective
experience of sickness. It is true that clinicians are trained to
capture the essence of illness by using concepts that delineate disease.
For instance the use of expressions such as relapse, recurrence,
remission and recovery.\ :sup:`59` In this way, the symptom profile is
used to transform the patient's illness (in a form of recasting of
illness in accordance with the theories of disorder) into a disease
formation.\ :sup:`57` The absence of an ongoing intervention other than
that relationship can be perceived by care managers as a need for
premature discharge from services, for fear of creating dependency.
However, some who use services desire an ongoing relationship, which
commonly matters more than interventions, and this aspect can be missing
in some recovery narratives. The construct of so-called ‘palliative
psychiatric care’ is informative in this regard.\ :sup:`60` Further,
moral experience is central to Kleinman's model of illness narratives,
incorporating constructs of ideal virtues of the practitioner\ :sup:`61`
and so opening up ‘illness narratives’ to create patient ‘storylines’,
which brings to life inanimate parts of practices, policies and
discourses.\ :sup:`62,63` Hajer suggests that storylines are ‘narratives
on social reality’, which combine elements from many different domains
and ‘provide actors with a set of symbolic references that suggest a
common understanding’.\ :sup:`64` Albeit critically, Kleinman also
envisaged that partnership is vital and is susceptible to change over
time, with caregiving perceived as a construct focused more on ‘doing
good for others in their world’ and projecting that ‘as earnest and
naïve as it sounds, it is what medicine is really about’.\ :sup:`65`

.. _sec2-6:

Patient perspectives of ‘corporate’ recovery/criticism
------------------------------------------------------

Despite the common understandings, it should be noted that some patients
remain suspicious of the recovery concept because it is potentially
intolerant of those who do not change, and so it may remain, in their
eyes, a source of oppression used against them.\ :sup:`66` There is a
recurring critique of recovery presented as the ‘next best
thing’,\ :sup:`67` and a mere form of symbolism, undermining ‘authentic
alliances’\ :sup:`68` donning recovery in a sense to reduce effective
support.\ :sup:`69` Service cuts have been associated with the manner in
which services and health systems manage future demand for mental
healthcare, allied to the economic cutbacks planned for financial
savings.\ :sup:`70,71` Consequently, recovery concepts used in this
method risk being used, or at least perceived, as indicative of
justification to reduce services or their ability to provide timely
input.

.. _sec3:

Moving forward: making it work
==============================

In the majority of English-speaking countries\ :sup:`40` the importance
clinical recovery\ :sup:`2` and personal recovery are touted in
guidelines for key clinicians.\ :sup:`72–76` The significance of
tackling personal recovery, in conjunction with more standard concepts
of clinical recovery,\ :sup:`2` is currently endorsed in guidance for
all key professions.\ :sup:`72–76` Whether it as a model or framework, a
movement or a guiding ethos, recovery is now ‘the hegemonic guiding
principle of public mental health policy’.\ :sup:`5` The social sciences
have already reworked treating disease as a process of medical
micro-encounters,\ :sup:`77` and to the idea that ‘disease problems’ can
occur within an individual's circumstances of everyday life.\ :sup:`76`
It is evident that researchers, clinicians and services alike may
require a more complex approach to personal narratives and construction
of meaning if individual recovery is to be more clearly
understood.\ :sup:`78`

Psychiatric treatment historically conceptualised primarily based on a
disease model could have the potential to impede the long-term treatment
and assessment of those with chronic difficulties and illness. Linked to
this assertion, Voronka has indicated that narratives can be utilised
and shaped as a ‘gap-mending’ strategy,\ :sup:`79` not merely because
they interfere with professional knowledge, but because they have the
power to strengthen the capabilities of individuals to bring forth
personal goals and generate a sense of identity,\ :sup:`17` a fusion, a
convergence to create a mechanism of acceptability, of both
person-directed management of illness and professionally directed
treatment of disease, or, in essence, shared understandings of recovery
and shared decision-making toward that outcome. Roberts and Hollins have
also encouraged that medicine ought to discern that ‘disease
understandings’ are embedded in patients’ experiences and their daily
lives, and are considerably tied to a person's social
history.\ :sup:`71` This necessitates clinicians to move from a
tradition of ‘paternalistic attitudes’ of helping or being the expert,
to create meaningful alliances.\ :sup:`80` Likewise, Lawton et al
described an approach to illness experiences that recognises a dynamic
interplay between ‘survivor’ and the healthcare system, whereby one
affects the other,\ :sup:`71,77` suggesting that medical encounters
merely comprise a relatively insignificant portion of most patients’
lives (although symbolically they may represent more). Accordingly, the
medical support to patients’ ‘sense-making’ tends, in reality, to be
exhausted by the conditions and encounters met in the extra-medical
social world.\ :sup:`81`

Recognising and embracing recovery concepts enhances care and the
therapeutic experience for professionals and patients. The possible
‘recursivity’ between services and perceptions is relevant to
understanding the way in which those with mental health problems might
engage with care services.\ :sup:`73,81` Peer support is increasingly
recognised and implemented within NHS services, with roles in the UK
typically at band 4/5; indeed, the Health Education England publication
‘Stepping Forward to 2021: The Mental Health Workforce Plan in England’
advocates even greater expansion of this.\ :sup:`82` Nevertheless, there
has equally been a call and need to deliver care in ways that have just
not been possible in traditional teams. A potentially very fruitful and
positive development in this regard has been the growth of recovery
colleges, driven by strong patient engagement and roles, often at odds
with, or at blurred boundaries to mainstream NHS services. Accordingly,
central to improving outcomes for individuals, services should involve
providing services that are ‘person-centred, strengths-based and
recovery-focused’.\ :sup:`74` To enable the interpretation of the
recovery approach into practice, there is a necessity to involving
illness narratives as a mechanism to personalise treatment and care so
that it can be operated and assessed within medical and research
environments.\ :sup:`20,25`
