We agree with the comment regarding how ethnic minority is an
independent effect with respect to differential attainment; however,
this paper tried to focus on the subgroup showing the largest effect
size, IMGs.

The comment regarding IMGs of White ethnicity is an illustration of the
above (ethnicity: moderate effect on differential attainment;
‘IMG-ness’: large effect on differential attainment), so we are grateful
you have helped us to make this point more explicit. However, we think
the central point of our paper remains – that IMGs need special focus
as, unlike ethnicity, to be an IMG is not a protected characteristic, so
interventions to support IMG might not be deemed to be a priority or
even a need. Overall, we consider that this is complex and delicate,
with many further layers of intersectionality, including gender, sexual
orientation and social background, but it is promising that more and
more work, including yours, is beginning to address the many issues
affecting IMGs working in the UK.
