All patients are sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) throughout their admission. The ward can accommodate 15 patients. Because of the relapsing and remitting nature of the mental disorders of many patients, several patients had multiple admissions during the study period; for these patients, data was gathered from medical records documented during their most recent admission.</p><p>Initially, 68 participants were included in the sample. Two participants were excluded from the analysis because of insufficient information in their medical records regarding their childhood, taking the final sample to 66 participants. Demographic and clinical information included age on admission, ethnicity, primary diagnosis, MHA section, personality disorder, alcohol and drug misuse, and violence history. Ethnicity was recorded into subsections: White British, Black British, Black African, Black Caribbean, Asian and other. Primary diagnosis was recorded into three categories, according to the ICD-10: schizophrenia spectrum disorders (codes F20&#x02013;F29), mood [affective] disorders (codes F30&#x02013;F39) and personality disorders (codes F60&#x02013;F69).<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> MHA sections of all patients were recorded into categories: forensic (section 37, sections 37 and 41, sections 47 and 49, and sections 48 and 49) and civil (section 3).<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-3"><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>Exposure to adverse experiences up to 18 years of age was assessed for each participant, following a thorough review of their medical notes; ACE history was summarised by a ten-item version of the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The ACE questionnaire consists of ten binary (yes/no) questions that assess exposure to emotional, physical and sexual abuse; emotional and physical neglect; and household dysfunction, including domestic violence, substance use and incarceration.

Self-harm was coded as a binary variable, with the presence of self-harm being recorded if there was any mention of self-harm or suicide attempt in adulthood mentioned in the medical records. ACEs were extracted from records of patients&#x02019; trauma history recorded in psychological and psychiatric reports contained in their medical records. Personality disorder presence was defined as a previous diagnosis of any type of personality disorder. Alcohol and drug misuse were defined as any positive history of problematic use of alcohol or drugs. History of violence was defined as any violence history before the event leading to admission.

Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed a statistically significant association between an increasing number of ACEs and increased likelihood of adulthood-self harm. Emotional abuse was shown to have a statistically significant association with adulthood self-harm.</p><p>We found a high prevalence of ACE exposure in this female MSU cohort, with over 80% of individuals experiencing at least one ACE and 56% experiencing more than two ACEs. The prevalence of ACE exposure among this female MSU group was higher than the 47% prevalence in the general adult population of the UK.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Within this population, there was a high prevalence of adulthood self-harm. Adulthood self-harm in our sample was reported by 54.5%, similar to the rates reported by Ribeiro et al<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (whose MSU population overlapped with ours), who found that 46.7% had a documented history of self-harm before MSU admission. Baker et al<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> interviewed female patients in a medium-secure setting and discussed their experiences of self-harm; an overarching theme discussed was that of &#x02018;the traumatised individual&#x02019;, suggesting that individuals linking their traumatic experiences to self-harming behaviour is not uncommon. The high prevalence of ACEs amongst the female MSU population indicates that a trauma-informed approach to care in MSU settings for women is crucial. Application of &#x02018;universal trauma precautions&#x02019; is necessary, to ensure that all who have been exposed to ACEs receive care that is not only growth-promoting, but also less likely to cause re-traumatisation than standard care.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>We found a statistically significant correlation between an increasing number of ACEs and the likelihood of adulthood self-harm. This is similar to research by Cleare et al,<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> showing that those with a history of repeat self-harm were significantly more likely to report exposure to multiple ACEs. Moreover, our finding of a statistically significant relationship between emotional abuse and adulthood self-harm supports the research by Howard et al,<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> who found a statistically significant association between emotional abuse and self-harm in a sample of female prisoners.</p><p>It was advantageous to focus on those admitted to a single female MSU over the past 11 years, as there is limited data regarding this population. Use of electronic medical records to obtain data meant minimal information was missing and there was low attrition. In this niche population, we achieved a good sample size; only around 12% of the 3500 MSU beds in the UK are occupied by women.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>The ACE questionnaire is limited as it provides no information regarding the severity, degree, duration, timing or quality of each ACE component, which may differ significantly from person to person. Furthermore, data collected about self-harm behaviours could have been improved by using the Inventory of Statements about Self-Injury questionnaire,<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> examining the type, frequency, severity and reasons for the behaviour. Further research could focus on collecting more in-depth childhood histories from patients, or using self-harm measures that capture frequency and severity.</p><p>Limited research is also available in forensic psychiatric settings, specifically MSUs, and nationwide research into ACEs and self-harm within these units could be beneficial. Furthermore, the neurodevelopmental and psychological mechanisms by which ACEs and self-harm are linked need exploration.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="other" id="nts1"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Rachel Holden</bold> is a clinical psychologist at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK, and a Clinical Psychologist Lecturer with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &#x00026; Neuroscience at King's College London, UK. <bold>Imogen Stables</bold> is a Medical Student at GKT School of Medical Education, King's College London, UK. <bold>Penelope Brown</bold> is a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Maria Fotiadou</bold> is a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec-das1"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, R.H., upon reasonable request.</p></sec><notes notes-type="other" id="nts3"><title>Author contributions</title><p>I.S. was involved in data collection, data analysis and writing of the manuscript.
