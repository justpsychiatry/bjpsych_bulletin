:Abstract:
   .. rubric:: Objectives

   The growing rate of retraction of scientific publications has
   attracted much attention within the academic community, but there is
   little knowledge about the nature of such retractions in
   schizophrenia-related research. This study aimed to analyze the
   characteristics of retractions of schizophrenia-related publications.

   .. rubric:: Materials and methods

   The Web of Science was searched for eligible studies. A bibliometric
   analysis was conducted to describe the characteristics of the
   retractions using R software and Excel 2019. Content analysis was
   conducted to examine the essential components of retraction notices.

   .. rubric:: Results

   A total of 36 retracted publications with 415 citations were
   identified from 1997 to 2021, of which, 83.3% occurred in the last
   decade. The overall retraction rate was 0.19%, with most of them (29;
   80.56%) from the United Kingdom. The retractions were published in 33
   journals, and the 2020 IFs ranged between 0.17 and 49.96 (Median =
   3.93). The retractions involved 21 research areas, particularly in
   Psychiatry (19; 52.78%), Neurosciences and Neurology (10; 27.78%),
   and Psychology (7; 19.44%). Data issues (17; 42.22%), administrative
   errors of the publishers (5; 13.89%), and study design (4; 11.11%)
   were the top three reasons for retractions.

   .. rubric:: Conclusion

   This study provides an insight into retractions of
   schizophrenia-related publications. Institutional governance should
   be further strengthened to improve the scrutiny of publications,
   prevent continuing citations, and erroneous propagation after
   retraction.

Introduction
============

Retraction of peer-reviewed scientific publications is becoming more
common. The growing rate of retractions with the increasing scientific
publications in recent years has attracted much attention. Numerous
reasons for retractions include concerns about data quality, and
research misconduct, such as redundant publication, plagiarism,
copyright infringement, unethical research, and peer review manipulation
(1). The main objectives of retraction are to ensure research integrity
rather than to punish authors, and to alert the academic community that
these publications’ findings are not credible and should not be cited
(2, 3). In the process of creating innovations, research outputs play a
vital role as an important medium for information communication and
presentation of findings. The filtering of these publications deserves
attention, as the risk of disseminating inaccurate information and
results of poor-quality research increases with the rapid expansion of
ongoing research (4). For instance, to date, 196 articles related to
COVID-19 have been retracted due to various reasons (5). If research
articles are fraudulent, they could lead to catastrophic consequences on
human health. In 1998, Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues
unethically conducted research on children and concluded that there was
a link between measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism;
consequently, thousands of parents refused MMR vaccines for their
children which caused an outbreak of fatal measles (6). This
misinformation continued to spread for at least 12 years, which had an
immeasurable health impact on families with children with autism and
also resulted in a huge financial cost to verify the accuracy of this
finding (6). Another paper that was retracted from The Lancet due to
doubtful data authenticity (7), claimed that hydroxychloroquine was
ineffective in treating COVID-19 and even caused arrhythmias, which
provoked a strong reaction in the scientific community and the public
(8).

The retraction rate of scientific publications across many fields has
been increasing in recent years. One study found a retraction rate of
0.38 per 10,000 publications in all fields in 1985, 2.03 in 2000, and
5.95 in 2014 (9), while another study found an average rate of 2.5 per
10,000 between 2013 and 2016 in all fields (10). A recent report found
that the retraction rate has increased 10 times in veterinary medicine
and animal health publications during the period between 1993 and 2019
(11). The trends of retractions varied by publication year (9) and
research field (12, 13). The most common reason for retraction is
academic misconduct, such as fraud or suspected fraud, duplicate
publications, and plagiarism (13, 14).

Previous studies have reviewed the retracted literature in different
specialties of medical fields, such as nursing and midwifery (15),
neurosurgery (16), hematology (13), and anesthesiology (1). However, few
studies have focused on the mental health literature (17). Schizophrenia
is a severe mental disorder characterized by disturbances in perceived
reality and behavior, such as persistent delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized thinking, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairment
(18–20). Approximately 1 in 300 people are affected worldwide, and its
global disease burden has increased 11.4% from 1990 to 2019 (21, 22).
Beyond the disease itself, relevant stigma and violations of human
rights associated with schizophrenia can have a significant impact on
the individual’s family, work, and social function (23–25).
Additionally, schizophrenia patients have a shorter life expectancy when
compared to the general population (18). Due to these features,
schizophrenia is one of the most important areas of research in
psychiatry and medicine.

A bibliometric analysis showed that the research on schizophrenia has
been increasing in recent years, involving a wide range of research
areas, including Psychiatry (69.8%), Neurosciences (20.7%), Clinical
Neurology (12.4%), Pharmacology and Pharmacy (9.6%), and
Genetics/Heredity (3.4%) (26). Schizophrenia related research has mainly
focused on epidemiology, etiology, and treatment aspects, but the
findings remained variable and at times controversial (18). Ensuring
academic rigor is important for the medical advancement in schizophrenia
and other fields of medicine. False research results could mislead the
academic community or drive researchers in wrong directions, leading to
much wasted research resources and negative impact on patient care and
recovery (27, 28). Timely retraction is an important measure to prevent
erroneous findings from being propagated. However, the nature of
retractions in schizophrenia-related publications is unknown.

Bibliometric analysis has been widely used to examine the research
trends in a specific field. Compared with traditional descriptive
reviews of the literature, it is based on two components: one is the
performance analysis that can provide the general characteristics of
relevant publications, such as the number of publications, publication
years, authors, institutions, countries, and journals; the other is
science mapping, which examines and visualizes the relationships between
research constituents such as co-citation analysis, bibliographic
coupling, co-word and co-authorship analyses. In recent years,
bibliometric analysis has been used to explore the characteristics of
retractions in academic fields such as rehabilitation (29) and oncology
(12). However, to the best of our knowledge, no bibliometric analysis on
schizophrenia-related publication retractions has been published. As
such, we performed a bibliometric analysis and content analysis of the
characteristics of retracted publications on this topic, including
publication years, sources, research areas, citations, and reasons for
retractions.

Materials and methods
=====================

The retracted publications on schizophrenia-related studies were
searched from the Web of Science Core Collection in the database of the
Web of Science (WoS). The search term was “TI/AB = *Schizophrenia OR
Schizophrenias OR Schizoaffective OR Schizophreniform OR Psychosis OR
Psychotic OR Schizophrenic Disorders OR Disorder, Schizophrenic OR
Disorders, Schizophrenic OR Schizophrenic Disorder OR Schizophrenic
Disorders OR Dementia Praecox OR Schizoaffective disorder OR Psychotic
Disorders*.” The article type was limited into “\ *Retracted
Publications and Retractions*.” A comprehensive screening procedure was
conducted manually to avoid false positive or negative results.

The R software and Excel 2019 were used to summarize the characteristics
of retractions, including the published year, countries, journals, and
research areas. The Journal Impact Factor (IF) in 2020 was used for
impact analysis of the journals. Given the rapid growth of journal
impact factors, a 5-year IF was used to describe the impact of journals,
as it is more stable compared to Immediacy IF. Furthermore, an IF
without journal self-citation was used to reduce the potential inflation
of IF because self-citation of journals could result in a higher IF
value (30). In addition, content analysis was used to examine the
reasons for retraction by reviewing the retraction notices. To analyze
the transparency of retraction notices, this study included the
following four essential components as previously recommended (3):
initiators, cause, whether there was consensus between editors and
authors on the retraction decisions, and whether retractions were
related to the post-publication review (such as comments on PubPeer).

Results
=======

A total of 19,176 publications on schizophrenia-related publications
were searched in WoS from its inception to the search date (20/03/2022).
Forty retractions were found after limiting the study types, four
articles were discarded due to irrelevant topics or duplications in the
process of data cleaning. Thirty-six publications from 1997 to 2021 were
finally included in this study; of all the retractions, 83.3% (*N* = 30)
occurred in the last decade. The overall retraction rate was 0.19%, and
the years of retraction were between 2002 and 2021. The distribution of
publication year, retraction year and annual citations are presented in
`Figure 1 <#F1>`__. The delay between publication and retraction time
(year) ranged from 0 to 10 years with an average of 1.89 years (standard
deviation = 2.22 years). The total citations of the 36 retracted
publications were 415, with the most citations arising from a single
publication (151) (31). The citations of the 36 retractions during the
recent ten years accounted for 49.9% (207) of the total citations.
`Figure 2 <#F2>`__ presents the distribution of research areas of the
retracted publications. The top three included Psychiatry (19, 52.78%),
Neurosciences and Neurology (10, 27.78%), and Psychology (7, 19.44%).

19.44%). `Table 2 <#T2>`__ shows that the 36 retractions were published
in 33 different journals. The IFs of the journals (in 2020) ranged
between 0.17 and 49.96, with a median of 3.93. The Journal of
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (*IF* = 2.22), Journal of ECT
(*IF* = 3.63), and Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences (*IF* = 5.12)
each retracted two publications, respectively. A total of 17 journals
(47.2%) were related to Psychology and Psychiatry.

`Supplementary Table 1 <#TS1>`__ shows the characteristics of the
retractions. All the 36 retraction notices reported the reasons for the
retraction. In sum, nine (25.0%) retraction notices did not report who
were the initiators, 24 (66.7%) did not report whether there was
consensus between editors and authors on the retraction decisions, and
28 (77.8%) did not report whether retractions were related to the
post-publication review. `Table 3 <#T3>`__ lists the reasons for
retraction as indicated by relevant journals, which include eight
categories: data issues (17; 42.22%), administrative errors of the
publisher (5; 13.89%), copyright (3; 8.33%), plagiarism (2; 5.56%),
redundant publications (2; 5.56%), study design issues (4; 11.11%),
ethical issues (1; 2.78%), and others (1, 2.78%). Based on the
classification of reasons for paper retraction outlined by the Committee
on Publication Ethics (COPE) (2), 11 (30.56%) out of the 36 retracted
publications were due to honest errors, including occasional errors made
in the original database or experimental data (7; 19.44%) and improper
data manipulation (4; 11.11%).

Discussion
==========

This is the first bibliometric study on retractions of
schizophrenia-related publications. We identified 36 retractions among
19,176 publications on schizophrenia-related studies. The overall
retraction rate was relatively lower (0.19%) compared with other fields
such as neurosurgery (7.3%) (16). Three-quarters of retractions occurred
during the past decade (2011–2021), a trend similar to the retractions
in the obstetrics literature where 76% of retractions occurred in the
recent decade (2009–2019) (27). This is likely to be related to the
overall growing number of academic publications, which may lead to
increased academic errors. Additionally, publishers have promoted the
awareness of scrutiny of publications (29). Academic misconduct has
become a priority in the review procedure for many journals. Currently,
many guidelines to standardize the process of retractions are available;
of them, the most authoritative guidelines were issued by the COPE (2).
The number of retractions has grown since the COPE guidelines were
published in 2009 (29). Our analysis revealed that the average gap
between publication and retraction time was 1.89 years, which is shorter
than the retractions in other fields such as nursing and midwifery (2.3
years) (15) and life science research (3.8 years) (9). A longer delay in
retraction may be associated with a more negative academic impact. The
erroneous research findings may mislead other researchers, resulting in
a waste of time, effort, and resources, and may even harm research
participants (27). The high citations of retracted publications suggest
that these retractions continued to have a certain impact on the
schizophrenia research field as some were still cited even after
retraction. Thus, a prompt retraction process is needed and clear signs
and labels, such as attaching a clear watermark to the retraction (32),
may be helpful in preventing further citations of retracted
publications.

The retracted publications identified in this study involved 21 research
areas; however, it should be noted that one retracted article may
involve more than one research area. More than half of the retractions
were classified in the field of Psychiatry (52.78%). The retractions
also involved some experiment-based research areas such as
Neurosciences, Neurology, Pharmacology, Pharmacy, and Behavioral
Sciences. A previous study (29) found that publications based on basic
experiments were more likely to be retracted for academic misconduct.
Certain countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, China,
Canada, and Germany were associated with the most retractions. However,
these countries also contributed to the most publications in
schizophrenia-related research; the United States contributed the most
publications, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and Canada
(26). Most retractions were published in journals related to
Psychology/Psychiatry, such as the American Journal of Psychiatry,
British Journal of Psychiatry, and Schizophrenia Bulletin. Given the
small number of retractions per journal, we could not examine the
correlation between the number of retractions and the impact factor of
the journals involved. Previous studies on the relationship between
retraction rate and journal impact factor found mixed results including
positive (33), negative (15), and also non-significant associations
(13).

This study analyzed all the retraction notices comprehensively to
understand the degree of transparency of retractions. Incomplete
information regarding the retraction notices will prevent any assessment
of their historical and academic significance, while inadequate
information can mislead or distort the readers and provide a biased view
(34). Thus, promoting the transparency of the retraction notices is
vital to maintain the scientific integrity by acting as a warning or
discontinuation measure (35). Although the COPE released a guideline to
formalize retraction notices, there has been little or no change to
improve the transparency (3). In our study, although the reasons for
schizophrenia-related retractions were reported, the other three
essential components (e.g., initiators, whether there is consensus
between editors and authors on the retraction decision, and whether
retractions are related to the post-publication review) were mostly
lacking. Possible reasons may include stigma (e.g., fear of reputational
damage or legal responsibility), inconsistent requirements regarding the
retraction notices between journals (34) and difficulties in
implementation. Thus, reform in reporting retractions can encourage
authors and publishers to explain the issues clearly and standardize the
information provided among journals.

Overall, 86% of retractions of schizophrenia-related studies were
attributed to author-related reasons. The most common reason was data
issues, of which 64.7% were honest errors. For example, one paper
published in Nature (111 citations) entitled “Microglia-dependent
synapse loss in type I interferon-mediated lupus” was retracted due to
the non-replicable results in the follow-up experiments (36). Another
highly-cited paper entitled “Expression of Oct-6, a POUIII domain
transcription factor, in schizophrenia” suggested that Oct-6 may be a
marker of the neuropathology associated with schizophrenia (37). The
data was suspected of being fraudulent; thus, the authenticity of this
finding was in doubt. Other studies were retracted due to incomplete
data (38), lack of original data (39), or errors in data processing that
led to biased conclusions (40). These findings highlight the importance
of data accuracy, integrity, and data double-checking.

In contrast, 13.89% of the retractions were due to journal or publisher
reasons, such as administrative errors, suggesting publishers should
enhance their measures to avoid such errors (16). Three retractions were
due to inconsistencies between the contents or research methods and the
original study design (41–43). For example, Ninomiya et al. (41)
examined the long-term efficacy and safety of blonanserin for
first-episode schizophrenia, which was retracted as subjects did not
satisfy the inclusion criteria. Incorrect or inappropriate research
results could mislead researchers, the public, or even entrepreneurs,
resulting in wasted research funds, selection of ineffective drug
treatments, and unethical profit-making (4, 44). A study may be invalid
or potentially harmful if it does not align with the content of the
original study registration. All clinical trials need to be registered
before implementation, such as in the International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (ICTRP) supported by the World Health Organization
(45). The aim is to ensure adequate knowledge about the research,
increase research transparency, and strengthen the validity and value of
the scientific evidence base (45).

The lack of ethical governance is another reason for retractions. One
paper from the American Journal of Gastroenterology with 151 citations
was retracted 10 years after publication; one of the reasons was having
no local ethics committee approval (31). Thus, authors, editors and
publishers should strengthen the consideration and review of all
submitted research information including appropriate ethical approvals.
The range and frequency of retraction reasons varied between different
academic fields. For example, in both dentistry and obstetrics,
redundant publications, and plagiarism were the most common reasons (27,
46), while in the field of pharmacy, falsification, or data manipulation
were the most frequent (47), which are in contrast to our findings in
schizophrenia-related research. The development and application of
Plagiarism Detection software, such as iThenticate and Turnitin (16,
46), may contribute considerably to preventing plagiarism issues.
Previous studies have proposed the notion of a “publish or perish”
culture to explain the research misconduct issues (1, 9, 48). Quantity
and quality of publications are associated with academic ranking,
promotion and reputation; further monetary incentives in research
commonly occur in some institutions/countries (49). Personality traits
combined with highly competitive pressures appear to drive some
researchers to falsify or fabricate data (1). Moreover, one study in
China found that the majority of survey respondents considered that the
current academic assessment system contributes heavily to academic
misconduct and needs to be reformed to create a healthy academic
environment (50). This supports the importance of developing appropriate
academic assessment criteria for researchers. We suggest that the
publication of good-quality research is a collaborative effort between
organizations, publishers, journals and authors to ensure transparency
in reporting, prevent research misconduct and disclose any research
limitations.

There are several limitations to this study. First, following relevant
guidelines of bibliometric analysis (51) and previous studies (52–54),
the WoS was used in the literature search. However, the possibility that
some studies may be missed could not be excluded. Second, some
retraction notices were conservative in stating the reasons for
retraction and the information was limited. For instance, where the
study results were not reproducible, it was unclear whether this was due
to research misconduct or honest errors. Thus, the retraction notices
should be standardized to improve transparency. Third, not all academic
misconduct could be uncovered by publishers or readers, therefore
retraction rates may well be underestimated.

Conclusion
==========

This study provides an insight into retractions of schizophrenia-related
research. The distribution of the retractions varied across countries,
journals, and research areas. The number of annual retractions has risen
over the past decade with the implementation of existing retraction
guidelines, and honest errors account for most retractions. Transparency
in reporting retraction notices should be implemented. Researchers
should employ measures to ensure the authenticity of their research
data. Institutional governance needs to improve the scrutiny of
publications and prevent continuing citations and erroneous propagation
after retraction.
