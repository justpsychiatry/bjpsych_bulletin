With depression in psychosis now being adopted in national and international clinical guidelines,<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> we wanted to explore whether any change in recognition has led to more effective management of depression in those with psychosis, particularly in the early stages of illness.</p><p>Overall, the majority of respondents (69.5%) indicated the use of antidepressant medication as a first line of treatment for young people with psychosis and comorbid depression. There was reasonable agreement among clinicians on the contextual factors and key symptoms that would prompt a prescription of antidepressant medication. For example, the majority of respondents reported low mood and anhedonia as the major symptoms for diagnosing depression (93% and 68%, respectively), with 45% also identifying anergia as a core symptom. Over 80% of participants reported that they would routinely prescribe a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sertraline in particular). This indicates a reasonable agreement between clinicians on the best strategy for managing comorbid depression with psychosis. These findings demonstrate a possible shift in the management strategy since Siris et al's<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> earlier publication, where a third of clinicians reported that they would rarely prescribe antidepressants in adjunct to antipsychotic medication.</p><p>Although previous studies have reported 70% prevalence rates of depression at illness onset,<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> our study showed fewer respondents (19%) identified depression as occurring frequently in FEP; instead, 54% reported observing depression occurring with stable psychosis. This might suggest that depression in the early phases of psychosis is still underrecognised; this is concerning, given that young people in particular are at heightened risk of suicide within the first 12 months following the initial episode of psychosis.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, it must also be acknowledged that the findings from our survey are reliant on the memory of clinicians, with a potential for recall bias, and so the accuracy of these findings may be challenged.</p><p>Despite a consensus on treatment strategies for depression, what became apparent from the survey was the uncertainty around assessing depression and delineating from psychosis symptoms, and particularly negative symptoms. Interestingly, a large proportion do not employ structured interview schedules to inform their assessment, which could aid this delineation. In particular, the CDSS was only used by 9% of respondents. The CDSS is a short and easily used instrument, designed specifically for the assessment of depression in psychosis, as it distinguishes between negative and positive symptoms.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Better promotion of these evaluation measures may be warranted.</p><p>There were also reports of challenges faced by clinicians in determining if the symptoms were part of an affective component of the psychotic episode, potentially highlighting the need for a better understanding of the diagnostic uncertainty and course of depression in early psychosis.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Over the past two decades, there appears to have been a shift in prescribing of antipsychotic medications &#x02013; particularly from the first generation (typical) to second generation (atypical) agents.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This is also reflected in our survey, where the majority were prescribing atypical agents such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine, compared with 4.9% and 3.9% of respondents prescribing haloperidol and zuclopenthixol. Thus, there appears to be a particular preference toward the antipsychotics believed to have the least side-effects, but not with recognition that some antipsychotics may have more antidepressant properties,<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or possibly promote depression, such as haloperidol.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>In regards to coprescribing in the present study, most respondents reported that there were no combinations of antidepressants and antipsychotics that they would actively avoid; however, some did express actively avoiding citalopram and antipsychotic in combination, with some citing risk of prolongation of the corrected QT interval. A similar percentage reported they would actively avoid a combination of mirtazapine and olanzapine because of increased risk of weight gain and sedation. In line with this, the majority of respondents (&#x0003e;70%) stated that they provided routine physical health monitoring when coprescribing. These findings indicate that clinicians are perhaps more cognisant of the potential physical health problems caused by antipsychotic medications, and may suggest proactiveness in mitigating such risks. Although this finding is encouraging, recent data shows that only 32.3% of individuals with severe mental illness in England receive a full physical health check.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Given the lowered life expectancy of individuals with schizophrenia, the current NICE recommendations advocate for annual physical health checks for all individuals with severe mental health problems.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Improving physical health monitoring should remain a top priority.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>Implications for clinical practice</title><p>Our results may indicate further training and embedding of routine assessment tools into clinical practice is be needed to further increase the recognition and management of depression, which, if achieved, could improve outcomes. Indeed, this finding is in keeping with the wider literature on the difficulty of promoting the use of instruments, such as the CDSS, into routine practice.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> A suggestion may be to embed these instruments into electronic patient records, and include monitoring of comorbidities as part of quality improvement programmes, and national audits such as the National Clinical Audit of Psychosis.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p>This study was the first to explore clinician recognition and management of depression in young people with FEP. Although the survey was completed by 297 clinicians, responses were underrepresented in certain parts of the country (particularly Wales, Northern Ireland and East Midlands), and overall response rate was low. On average, a third of the participants who completed the survey also returned incomplete questionnaires, affecting the overall representativeness of the information provided.</p><p>This study relied on the clinician reflecting on their previous practice, awareness and general approach, and they were provided with multiple options for each question. As such, there is a potential for recall bias. Furthermore, some questions were focused on depression within psychosis more generally, meaning that responses were less specific to depression in FEP. It is also very likely that clinicians within the Early Intervention Service and those with more interest in this field may have been more involved in the survey. An Amazon voucher was also offered as an incentive for participation, again, further introducing a respondent bias.</p><p>Another limitation was in disseminating the survey. Because of regulations governing the Royal College of Psychiatry, emails were only distributed to members registered under the General Adult Psychiatry faculty. The questionnaire was not disseminated to other psychiatric disciplines that may have been relevant, such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, and Forensic or Learning Disability subspecialties. Finally, the survey was UK-based, with a low response rate. Further research is required to understand whether these practices are uniform in a larger sample of participants, and across different countries, particularly in the USA and Europe.</p><p>In conclusion, although there is now more consensus on recognising depression in early psychosis strategies, there continues to be variations in the approach toward its assessment and management (e.g. in the use of specific interview schedules or evaluation measures to assess depression in those with psychosis). Although our findings are tentative, given the low response rate, the survey indicates that adjunctive treatment is being administered by most clinicians; however, some expressed difficulties in differentiating between depression occurring in relation to psychosis and negative symptoms of psychosis, and there was little consensus on treatment duration and time of expectation of response. Embedding of structured assessment tools into routine practice, in addition to devising clearer national guidelines based on large definitive trials, would be instrumental in improving future practice in early psychosis, potentially leading to improved outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Royal College of Psychiatrists for supporting our research by distributing our study information to its members.
