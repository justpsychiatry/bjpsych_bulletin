The aim was to identify whether the potential bias toward veganism found within the general population is prevalent within SED professionals. Findings suggested all three professional groups held positive veganism attitudes, with GMH professionals holding significantly more positive attitudes than SED and other professionals. Despite age and gender influencing veganism attitudes in the general population, no statistically significant age or gender differences were found within these professional groups.</p><p>Research has highlighted a level of bias against veganism within Western populations,<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> leading to it being viewed as a minority group similar to ethnicity or sexual orientation.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Not only are vegans often depicted as going against the status quo of normal dietary culture, but these attitudes are influenced by gender and age, with more prominent negative attitudes often found in older, male generations. As well as investigating whether these biases exist within SED professional populations, it was hypothesised that SED professionals would have a more negative view on veganism than other professionals. This is because SED professionals are aware of how dietary restrictions can negatively affect an individual's physical health and mental health. These general attitudes could be reflected in SED professionals&#x02019; own veganism attitudes, and SED professionals should be aware of any such biases, as they could affect clinical practice and patient treatment. In 2019, a joint consensus statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the British Dietetic Association and &#x02018;BEAT&#x02019;, the national eating disorder charity, was released regarding the importance of working collaboratively with vegan patients with eating disorders.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This sought to address concerns raised by some vegan patients that their beliefs were ignored in treatment and that staff could be biased against veganism. In contrast, the current study appears to indicate that SED professionals are not biased toward veganism.</p><p>These findings are particularly important because SED professionals may be concerned when patients presenting with eating disorders make any significant dietary change before seeking treatment. Self-imposed dietary restrictions are common in patients with restrictive eating disorders. These restrictions can be total caloric restriction, but can also involve excluding entire food groups such as carbohydrates or fats, or excluding ingredients in foods such as lactose or gluten. It is not uncommon to see numerous, escalating self-imposed dietary restrictions as a patient's eating disorder progresses. For example, someone who previously ate a diet that included meat could become pescatarian, then vegetarian and finally vegan &#x02013; with each dietary change becoming more restrictive. There is evidence that there are increased rates of vegetarianism in patients with restrictive eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> As veganism requires more dietary restrictions than vegetarianism, researchers suggest that a similar link could be associated with veganism,<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which could raise concerns for SED professionals. Furthermore, SED professionals will be aware of the overlap in the demographics of veganism and factors that make an individual more susceptable to an eating disorder.</p><p>To adopt a vegan diet, an individual must avoid all animal products, ingredients or derivatives. Therefore, this requires them to check dietary labels and will result in the exclusion of foods they previously ate. These two behaviours, checking labels and food exclusion based on ingredients, are often seen in patients with restrictive eating disorders regardless of their overall dietary choice. These firm dietary rules veganism provides can be very attractive to patients who are anxious regarding what to eat. Based on the findings of the current study above, SED professionals do not show a bias against veganism. However, as research suggests that the general population perceive multiple barriers to switching to a vegan diet,<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> SED clinicians may therefore be suspicious of the apparent coincidence of such a dietary change during the onset of the eating disorder.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>Findings from this research suggest that SED professionals do not have more negative views on veganism compared with GMH and other professionals. Instead, all groups held positive attitudes toward veganism, with GMH professionals statistically holding the most positive views. This finding may be partly mediated by participant demographics, as GMH professional participants tended to be younger women compared with SED and other professionals. Knowing that SED professionals did not have a negative attitude toward veganism is important because when exploring a patient's veganism, the patient may feel vulnerable having a clinician challenge behaviour that may or may not be associated with their eating disorder. SED professionals can use this research to reassure patients that it is their eating disorder that is being questioned and not their veganism. Taking this dynamic further, it is important for these professionals to be aware of their &#x02018;social GRACES&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This acronym was developed for clinicians to be aware of the many areas in life where we may have conscious or unconscious bias in clinical work. Using this acronym, there is more than one topic within each &#x02018;letter&#x02019; and the full acronym is &#x02018;GGRRAAACCEEESSS&#x02019;, encompassing gender, geography, race, religion, age, ability, appearance, class, culture, ethnicity, education, employment, sexuality, sexual orientation and spirituality.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Clinicians have both an ethical and legal responsibility to their patients not to bring any bias into the treatments they offer, if they themselves have different dietary choices from their patients,<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> so there could be a D added to the &#x02018;social GRACES&#x02019; &#x02013; that of diet and dietary choice.</p><p>This research also has a much broader impact as it also reflects that SED professionals are practicing within relevant legal frameworks. As veganism is a protected characteristic within the law, these finds are important.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> If the main hypothesis of this study had been supported, it would have raised concerns that these professionals&#x02019; opinions were significantly different. Going forward, our findings highlight the need for all SED clinicians to have an awareness of the nuanced issues veganism can bring for a patient with an eating disorder, as well as an awareness of the legal protection this characteristic holds. Navigating this difficult dynamic may be helped by this research, as it is one of the first studies to consider these issues.</p><p>These findings can be generalised to the wider UK SED profession, and will inform daily clinical practice, particularly as veganism is becoming more popular nationally.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The good response rate and high completion rates suggest that veganism is a topic of interest for professionals. Further international research could help generalise these findings in the wider Western world and globally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>Bias was minimised by using reversed questions, valid instruments and measures, but future research in this area should recognise possibilities for bias. Because of the self-reported nature of this research, participants may have shown demand characteristics (participants changing reported behaviours in line with their interpretation of the study) that may have influenced the findings, particularly given the potential implications for SED and GMH professionals.

Research targeting vegan SED professionals will provide an unbiased understanding of how veganism may be used to facilitate dietary restriction in patients with eating disorders. Although ethically sensitive, future research could focus on the extent that patients who have recovered from an eating disorder feel that veganism can be used to facilitate dietary restriction in eating disorders. Including SED professionals and patients who have recovered from an eating disorder from a range of demographics, including age, gender and ethnicity, would allow a more culturally diverse interpretation of this topic area.</p><p>The current research study was targeted at clinicians who work either in adult, child or adolescent mental health services. These clinicians may have different attitudes toward veganism when they are working with a child or an adult, and future research should consider potential differences here. For example, a 12-year-old girl who is presenting with a restrictive eating disorder and asking to become vegan for animal welfare reasons may evoke concerns from clinicians regarding the authenticity of this dietary change, especially when the nutritional adequacy of the vegan diet can be hard to achieve in this age group because of the nutritional demands of growth and puberty.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In contrast, an adult patient following a vegan diet because of a family history of heart disease may seem less concerning to SED professionals, and this research did not differentiate between the different motivations a patient may have. Therefore, future research should differentiate within the SED group by their area of speciality &#x02013; children and young people or adult. Theoretically, an age-informed professional consensus could be developed, potentially demonstrating greater concern for younger patients or those who are following an increasing pattern of dietary restrictions leading to veganism.</p><p>In conclusion, veganism is an increasing and legally protected characteristic, but the general population hold negative attitudes toward veganism. Research identifies important similarities between vegan demographics and those at risk of developing an eating disorder. As a patient's veganism may be challenged as part of their eating disorder treatment, it is important to identify if SED professionals hold the same biases, as this could have important implications for patient care and practice. This is the first study to highlight that SED professionals do not appear to be biased; in contrast, they hold positive views toward veganism, as do GMH and other professionals. Not only does this research suggest that SED professionals are practicing within the law, but it also indicates that they are aware of their social GRACES, and perhaps a &#x02018;D&#x02019; for &#x02018;diet&#x02019; could be added to this acronym. Further in-depth and more diverse research into professional's attitudes toward veganism is encouraged.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Sarah J.
