These RCTs must have compared a group that received a decision aid that aimed to help patients decide about their treatment for any kind of depression treatment (as a stand-alone intervention, or as the main element within a complex intervention) with a group that did not, and directly assessed any beneficial or adverse effects in adults with depression. We excluded RCTs that had as population only pregnant women because they have different risks that should be considered when deciding whether to use antidepressants.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Also, we excluded conference papers. There were no restrictions on language or publication date.</p><p>Decision aids were defined as tools or technologies used to help patients make informed decisions by offering information about treatment options, and help them to construct, clarify and communicate their values and preferences.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> However, sometimes it is difficult to differentiate from other information-based interventions.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> To define if the proposed intervention was a decision aid, we used the six-item qualifying criteria for decision aids developed by the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration, as it provides the definition standards for decision aids: (a) describes the health condition or problem for which the index decision is required, (b) states the decision that needs to be considered, (c) describes the options available for the index decision, (d) describes the positive features of each option, (e) describes the negative features of each option and (f) describes what it is like to experience the consequences of the options.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>The decision aid assessed by the RCTs needed to meet all six criteria to be included in our systematic review.</p><p>A literature search was performed in two steps: a systematic review of five databases, and a review of all documents cited by any of the studies included in the first step. For the first step, we performed a literature search in five databases: Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used terms related to decision support, decision aid, decision-making, depression and clinical trials.

Duplicated records were removed with EndNote version X8 for Windows (Clarivate Analytics, Thomson Reuters, New York; see <uri xlink:href="https://endnote.com/">https://endnote.com/</uri>). After that, titles and abstracts were independently screened by two pairs of independent reviewers (C.A.A.-R. with M.E.D.-B., and N.B.-C. with C.J.T.-H.) to identify potentially relevant articles for inclusion.

This classification is based on the following criteria: risk of bias (evaluated through the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool), inconsistency (heterogeneity between the RCT results and in terms of population, intervention, comparator and outcome; additionally assessed by the <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> test), indirectness (how different are the included RCTs to the question of interest) and imprecision (wideness of the confidence interval). The certainty of the evidence was assessed for all meta-analysed outcomes and non-meta-analysed outcomes that were important for decision- making. Additionally, when two or more RCTs assessed the same outcome, but a meta-analysis was not performed, we summarised the individual data of each RCT narratively, and then assessed the certainty of the evidence following the recommendations proposed by Murad et al.<sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We performed meta-analyses to summarise the results of the RCTs that evaluated the same outcomes. When outcomes were measured with different scales across studies, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) to compare and meta-analyse these studies; otherwise, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD). For outcomes that had been measured more than once, we only considered the final measurement to perform the meta-analyses, as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We assessed heterogeneity with the <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic, and we considered that heterogeneity might not be significant when <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;40%.<sup><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> We considered it appropriate to use random-effects models in all the meta-analysis because of the overall heterogeneity in terms of population, intervention and comparators.<sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> We executed a sensitivity analysis, taking into account contradictory results within studies. We did not considerer to exclude studies with high risk for bias for sensitivity analysis, because all the included RCTs had at least one domain of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool with a high risk of bias. Also, we did not execute a subgroup analysis because of the low number of studies by each meta-analysis. Publication bias was not statistically assessed because the number of studies pooled for each meta-analysis was less than ten.<sup><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The data were processed with Stata version 15.0 for Windows.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>Studies characteristics</title><p>We found a total of 3309 titles.

These studies were heterogeneous, had small sample sizes and presented with a high risk of bias. When pooling the RCTs, we found benefits in some outcomes such as decisional conflict, patient knowledge and information exchange, but not in clinical outcomes such as depression symptoms or treatment adherence. All of the outcomes included in the Summary of Findings table had very low certainty of evidence.</p><p>The interventions used in the six included RCTs fulfilled all the qualifying items from the International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration criteria.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> However, there was heterogeneity regarding the type of decision aids used (including leaflets, booklets, cards, DVD, a webpage or artificial intelligence), treatment options in the decision aids and by whom they were administered (physicians, pharmacists, researchers or the patient themselves). This heterogeneity is expected because the use of the decision aids largely depends on context, and has to be adapted according to population needs.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, the fact that there were not even two studies that used the same decision aid affects the capability of synthesis and interpretation of the pooled results.<sup><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding the quality of the included RCTs, participants were not blinded because of the intervention's intrinsic nature. This represents an important source of bias as the perception of subjective outcomes could have been influenced.<sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Additionally, most RCTs used a no-intervention group as the control without placebo. However, using an information-based intervention about treatment options for depression without a decision-making process as a control group in the RCTs would have helped to prevent the complex intervention effects, and ensure that the effects of the decision aid are not explained only by higher attention from a health professional.<sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding the effects of decision aid, our pooled estimates suggest no effect in clinical outcomes, as described by a previous review that assessed decision aid in patients with mood disorders and found no effect with depressive symptoms,<sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and by another systematic review that assessed decision aid for screening tests and found no effect in treatment adherence.<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> These results could be explained by a linear and logical sequence that we propose. First, the decision aid gives the information to the patient about depression and its treatment options, which explains the &#x02018;knowledge&#x02019; improvement. Then, the patients are more capable of discussing the disease and their treatment options with the health professional, which explains the &#x02018;information exchange&#x02019; improvement. Later, the patient feels capable of making a choice, which explains the decrease in &#x02018;decisional conflict&#x02019;. After making a choice, the patients receive their treatment and feel satisfied with their decision, which improves the &#x02018;sure of the intention to choose a treatment&#x02019;, the &#x02018;treatment satisfaction&#x02019; and the &#x02018;decision aid satisfaction&#x02019;. Lastly, it would be expected that all of these achievements are translated into clinical outcomes: a higher treatment adherence and subsequent reduction of depressive symptoms.</p><p>However, regarding this last point, other factors could influence clinical outcomes. Adherence could be affected by accessibility to the treatment, the way the patients perceive the effectiveness of the treatment, severity of the disease, etc.<sup><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Additionally, depressive symptoms could be affected by the treatment adherence itself, the adequacy of the chosen treatment for the clinical characteristics of the patient and other psychosocial factors.<sup><xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> In addition, some methodological issues could explain the results. None of the studies included in the meta-analysis of depressive symptoms, and only one of the three studies included in the meta-analysis of treatment adherence were designed to assess those outcomes, so there could have been a lack of power to find a difference between study groups.</p><p>The pooled analysis found no effect of decision aids on treatment adherence (SMD &#x02212;0.31 to 0.71). This meta-analysis included three RCTs.<sup><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> One of them<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> contradicted the results of the other two, in addition to having the smallest sample size and the highest risk of bias (as a result of attrition bias and small sample size). Thus, a sensitivity analysis removing that RCT found a beneficial effect of decision aids for treatment adherence (SMD 0.50; 95% CI 0.29&#x02013;0.70). Thus, we cannot exclude a possible positive effect of decision aids on treatment adherence, which has to be assessed in future studies.</p><p>On the other hand, we did find beneficial effects in decision-making process outcomes, such as decisional conflict, information exchange and patient knowledge, similar to a previous review.<sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> These three outcomes are expected for a decision aid designed to facilitate the shared decision-making process. Five<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> out of six RCTs assessed decision aids developed to enhance patients&#x02019; involvement in the decision-making process, support their choices, empower them and improve their knowledge about their therapeutic options. Consequently, the decision aid's main objective may determine the outcomes (decision process or clinical outcomes) it will affect. Future studies assessing decision aid clinical outcomes must assess a decision aid specially designed to improve clinical outcomes, such as treatment adherence, depressive symptoms and quality of life.</p><p>Altogether, our results suggest that the use of a decision aid in patients with depression may have an effect on knowledge, information and decision-related outcomes. However, its effect on adherence is doubtful, and there seems to be no effect on depressive symptoms. Although we found a very low certainty of the evidence, stakeholders are needed to decide in this regard. Healthcare institutions must consider the costs, acceptability and applicability of this intervention in their context. Additionally, healthcare professionals must consider the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the decision aid's application, and acknowledge the patient information and involvement as decisive components for the shared decision-making process,<sup><xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> to make a decision applicable to each particular patient.</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec4-1"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>Our study included a small number of heterogeneous studies. However, we decided to conduct a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis about the overall effect of decision aid in patients with depression, for a better decision-making process.<sup><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> The certainty of the evidence was very low for all the prioritised outcomes, which demonstrates the need for more well-designed and adequately reported RCTs with higher sample sizes.</p><p>On the other hand, this systematic review has important strengths: it followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and was inscribed in the PROSPERO database. Also, we performed a comprehensive search strategy across multiple databases, without language restriction, and across articles that cited each of the found studies, which allowed us to find all studies reported in previous systematic reviews<sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and other studies that were not found in these reviews. Lastly, we evaluated the certainty of evidence with the GRADE methodology.</p><p>In conclusion, we found six RCTs that evaluated the effects of decision aid in adults with depression. Evidence of very low certainty suggests that decision aids may have benefits in decisional conflict, patient knowledge and information exchange, but not in clinical outcomes (treatment adherence and depression symptoms).
