The NHS Long Term Plan makes a renewed commitment to improve and widen access for adults needing mental health support partly through a new community-based offer. This includes access to employment support for people with severe mental health problems through the expansion of the evidence-based individual placement and support (IPS) approach.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>IPS involves a direct, individualised search for competitive employment that avoids lengthy pre-employment preparation or training and does not screen people for work &#x02018;readiness&#x02019;. It does not exclude people on the basis of diagnosis, symptoms or substance misuse. IPS is a &#x02018;place and train&#x02019; approach, rather than a traditional &#x02018;train and place&#x02019; approach, to vocational rehabilitation. There are now 27 randomised controlled trials supporting the efficacy of IPS compared with traditional vocational rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends IPS for people with severe mental health problems who wish to gain and retain employment.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Within this context, consideration needs to be given to ensuring that people from BAME communities have fair access to employment support and equal opportunities to gain employment. There has been considerable concern that there is no parity between BAME communities and the White majority in access, experience and outcomes of mental healthcare<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and so it is right that we ask questions about the effectiveness of IPS for BAME groups.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Method</title><p>This was a service evaluation of two IPS services in London.

The CNWL IPS service is provided by the trust and all employment specialists are trust employees and members of multidisciplinary adult community mental health teams.

For men and women, young and old there were no significant differences between the proportions who gained employment by the end of the year in which they accessed IPS services. It is not known whether similar results would be obtained in less well-established services &#x02013; it takes time to implement an effective IPS service. With the NHS England national roll-out of IPS it is essential that routine service monitoring includes access and outcome data broken down by ethnicity to demonstrate the key IPS principle of &#x02018;zero exclusion&#x02019; that ensures services are equally effective across different communities.</p><p>Although the proportions of men and women accessing these IPS services did not differ, there were significant differences in the proportions of people of different ethnicities accessing them. These differences do not suggest differential disadvantage for people from BAME communities. Quite the reverse, the proportions of Black/Black British people accessing each IPS services were higher than their proportions in the populations of people using secondary adult community mental health services in the areas (CNWL: 17.5 <italic toggle="yes">v.</italic> 11.5%; WWT: 18.0 <italic toggle="yes">v.</italic> 11.8%). However, there are marked differences between the two services: in CNWL the proportion of people from different ethnic communities accessing IPS did not differ markedly, but at WWT there were substantial differences. The reasons for this cannot be ascertained from the data. For example, it may reflect a positive bias in referrals to IPS or a greater interest in work opportunities by the different ethnic communities (perhaps itself reflecting greater deprivation/different employment rates). The data considered here are for those who engaged with the services: it is not known how many were referred but did not engage with the service offered. It should also be noted that the &#x02018;not known/stated&#x02019; ethnicity category was higher in CNWL than in WWT/Tower Hamlets adult mental health services.</p><p>It has sometimes been suggested that South Asian communities may be protective of people with psychosis and consider employment as a risk. Our study would suggest that this is not the case. It showed no differences in access or outcome for Asian/Asian British people. Similarly, previous research has demonstrated that Asian/Asian British people using IPS services were more likely to be in employment than their White counterparts.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, in our study it should also be noted that, although in CNWL the proportion of Asian/Asian British people was substantially higher among those accessing IPS services than among the adult community mental health services population (21.1 <italic toggle="yes">v.</italic> 16.5%), in WWT it was lower (32.7 <italic toggle="yes">v.</italic> 36.7%). It is possible that this difference results from different composition of the Asian/Asian British population (WWT: 80.5% Bangladeshi, 4.9% Indian, 4.1% Pakistani; CNWL: 4.8% Bangladeshi, 41.7% Indian, 13.6% Pakistani). Clearly this area requires greater understanding and a more detailed breakdown of ethnicity than was possible here.</p><p>Literature relating to BAME communities and mental health services is replete with examples of disparities in access, experience and outcome of services and, in particular, high levels of compulsion.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In England, people with mental health problems from BAME communities have been less likely to use employment support services and as a consequence have been less likely to succeed in gaining employment than their White British peers.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Morgan et al<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> have suggested that addressing the social needs of BAME patients is likely to lead to improved clinical outcomes and engagement with services. Perhaps increasing the availability of IPS is one good way of doing this?</p><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-1"><title>How IPS works</title><p>IPS services are entirely voluntary. In line with the fidelity standards for IPS,<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> an employment specialist is integrated into a clinical team. People using secondary mental health services can access IPS services if they themselves want to work &#x02013; there is no selection on the basis of diagnosis or supposed &#x02018;readiness&#x02019; for work. IPS is personalised and based on the individual's preferences and choices &#x02013; very different from typical mainstream employment support programmes. Through shared decision-making, IPS rebalances power and encourages a collaborative dialogue between the employment specialist and the individual. Shared decision-making relies on two sources of expertise: the employment specialist as an expert on supporting individuals with mental health problems to gain and retain employment, and the individual as an expert on themselves, their social circumstances, attitudes to work, and health, values and preferences. Both must be willing to share information and accept responsibility for joint decision-making. The employment specialist needs to provide information about the most effective ways to gain and retain employment. The individual needs to tell the employment specialist about their preferences. As IPS is integrated into the clinical team, the challenge for mental health professionals is not to decide who can and who cannot work but how to support people on their case-loads to access IPS and move forward with life beyond their illness.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Two interesting findings arise from this study: a disproportionate number of Black/Black British people were attracted to the IPS services &#x02013; gaining employment was of importance to them &#x02013; and there were no significant differences in outcomes for people from different ethnic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>Limitations and implications</title><p>Clearly, further research is necessary. The naturalistic design of this study is a limitation yet provides a real-world understanding of access to and outcomes from IPS services achieved for BAME communities using secondary mental health services. The data collected here considered only outcomes at the end of the year studied. It is possible that others would have gone on to gain employment had longer-term follow-up been possible. Data on type of employment and job tenure were not collected, neither could people's experience of using the services be ascertained, and a more detailed breakdown of ethnicity than was possible here would clearly be desirable. However, it is interesting to note that, of the three randomised controlled trials of IPS in England, none has reported outcomes by ethnicity,<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> whereas some of the naturalistic studies have.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Although there is a clear need for better quantitative data, the collection of qualitative data relating to people's experience of using IPS services is necessary to understand some of the differences found and ensure equality of access and outcome for all.</p><p>Everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, without discrimination, and to be able to access appropriate mental healthcare when it is needed. Identifying and reducing health inequalities in access, experience and outcomes is essential to the delivery of high-quality mental healthcare. Mental health services have a duty to use data and existing resources to identify inequalities. The present study strongly suggests that people from BAME communities are not differentially disadvantaged in relation to either access to or outcomes of IPS employment support services.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Rachel Perkins</bold> is a clinical psychologist and senior consultant at Implementing Recovery through Organisational Change (ImROC), based in London, UK. <bold>Rash Patel</bold> is Head of Employment and Volunteering at Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. <bold>Amelia Willett</bold> is Operations Director at the Working Well Trust, London, UK. <bold>Laura Chisholm</bold> is Employment Services Manager at the Working Well Trust, London, UK. <bold>Miles Rinaldi</bold> is Head of Strategic Development at South West London and St George's Mental Health NHS Trust, London, UK.</p></notes><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec-das"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data are available from the corresponding author.</p></sec><notes id="nts3" notes-type="other"><title>Author contributions</title><p>R.Pe. is the lead author.
