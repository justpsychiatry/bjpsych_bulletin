The median scores indicate participants in the video condition had more correct knowledge and a more positive attitude. Importantly, in the attitudes to ECT factor only the video condition showed a median score above the mid-point, indicating a positive attitude. Receiving no intervention or the ECT leaflet had distributions that sat mostly below the mid-point for both knowledge and attitudes, thus meaning the video condition was the only form of intervention likely to encourage accurate knowledge and facilitate a more positive attitude toward ECT when compared with receiving no information or the current leaflet. These findings suggest that video information is the most positive tool of the three studied.

This suggests the increase in positive attitude to ECT after watching the video exists after controlling for the underlying trait empathy. It also suggests empathic perspective-taking accounts for a very small but significant portion of the variance in attitudes to ECT. <xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the relationship between emotional perspective-taking on ECT attitudes in each of the three conditions. Although the regression line for the video was similar across the range of perspective-taking scores (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.06, s.e. 0.25), there was a small positive relationship for the NHS leaflet group (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.29, s.e. 0.16) and the no information group (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.30, s.e. 0.21). When perspective trait empathy was high, attitudes toward ECT in the three information conditions were similar; when perspective trait empathy was low, attitudes toward ECT scores in the new video condition were higher than the NHS leaflet and no information conditions. From this, we can infer that the style of intervention had little effect on those already high in trait empathy; however, for those with low trait empathy, the video proved beneficial for improving perceptions of ECT.

Only the video condition improved knowledge and attitudes to ECT, whereas the leaflet currently used by the NHS did not improve either knowledge or attitudes compared with no information. For both the no intervention condition and the leaflet condition, participants sat below the mid-point for attitudes and on or below the mid-point for knowledge, suggesting that they were still inclined to perceive ECT negatively. These findings suggest that, compared with other styles of intervention, the video would work best to educate patients and carers on the use of ECT to treat mental health illnesses. These results support current literature which suggests that interventions focusing on more emotional, real-life experience may be more effective for perception improvement than using factual information alone.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> It should be noted that all the main and covariate effects were small, and the distributions in all three experimental conditions had participants that perceived ECT both positively and negatively. This suggests that although the video may help to improve perceptions of ECT, it is not a &#x02018;silver bullet&#x02019;, and might best used alongside other informational material. Future research should assess whether combining the leaflet and the video improved the perceptions above and beyond the video alone.</p><p>An alternate explanation for our results may be the modal differences between video and written information; the introduction of a dynamic stimulus may have been enough to demand more attention from participants than reading a leaflet. Some research has suggested showing patients a video can reduce anxiety around healthcare treatments more than written information.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> To address this, it would be important to examine whether a similar improvement in knowledge and attitudes is found irrespective of how the content was delivered. It should also be noted that although the efficacy of ECT is outside of the scope of this research, there is still large debate as to whether there are any noticeable and long-lasting benefits to undergoing ECT.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Additionally, meta-analyses report high relapse rates among many patients.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> There are some ethical considerations on whether improving attitudes toward ECT is acceptable if the benefit of the treatment is, in some cases, limited and relapse is likely.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-2"><title>The role of trait empathy</title><p>We hypothesised that trait empathy would offer some explanation as to why emotional content was more effective compared with scientific information. We found that perspective-taking influenced attitudes to ECT, but this was only the case for participants who received no information or the NHS leaflet; those with higher perspective-taking trait empathy had a more positive attitude to ECT. Perspective-taking had no effect on attitudes to ECT in the video condition. Therefore, participants with high perspective-taking scores had similar attitudes to ECT in all three conditions, whereas participants with lower perspective-taking empathy had a more negative perception of ECT in the leaflet and no information groups compared with the video group. The video, therefore, seemed to directly improve the attitude of participants who had lower perspective-taking abilities. The proposed reason for this is that the video directly adds context to ECT as a treatment. This allowed participants with lower perspective-taking empathy to relate to the treatment or participants in a similar way to those participants with high perspective-taking empathy.</p><p>This explanation seems to be consistent with evidence from neuroimaging studies, which has demonstrated a link between perspective-taking ability and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> a brain area that is also critical for perception and reaction to the suffering of others.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Thus, scoring higher in perspective-taking may make an individual more likely to be able to imagine the suffering of those experiencing severe mental health problems, which explains why they may react more positively to ECT even with limited information around the treatment. Furthermore, adding context in the form of another person's account can elicit a more empathetic response from participants when making decisions,<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>and that the empathy elicited is generally more appropriate when context is present;<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> this suggests that the context in the video may have encouraged a more empathetic response to the content, even for those who do not naturally empathise with another's situation</p><p>Alongside the significant covariate effect of trait empathy, gender was found to be a separate significant covariate for both knowledge and attitudes. We suspect that the known gender variation in empathy<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> can partly explain why gender was a significant covariate. This information provides grounds to suggest further research is conducted into the effect of an emotional, video-based stimulus, and whether any specific gender effects exist in relation to the efficacy of these training materials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-3"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>These findings provide a deeper insight into the use of education to improve perception of ECT, with emotional stimuli proving to be the best method for information delivery, especially for people with low perspective-taking empathy. Overall, better knowledge of people's experiences with ECT may ultimately mean less fear and apprehension among the public.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The results of our findings can be used as a recommendation for both the NHS and the wider health sector on how to structure and deliver their informational material. A critical point seems to be that personal accounts and context are important in the effective delivery of health information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec3-4"><title>Limitations and suggestions for future research</title><p>This study focuses on ECT, which carries a large amount of stigma.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Going forward, it could be interesting to explore whether the effect exists with other health treatments with potential negative public perceptions. Some alternative treatments still have stigma attached,<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and contextual evidence may be the key to improving perceptions of these treatments for mental health illnesses. The results provide grounds to recommend that more emotive content should be introduced when educating the public about mental health. Suffering from a mental health disorder can still affect your ability to find work and maintain relationships.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Further, certain disorders, such as schizophrenia and psychosis, are still hugely feared by the general public.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Introducing a context and personal experiences to these illnesses helps to distinguish between mental health in the real world and the overdramatization of disorders fed to the public by the media.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Making the distinction between individual and symptom could help integration in society, improve quality of life and aid recovery for those with a mental illness.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Karen Osala, Hannah Watts and Mark Pointer from Southern Health NHS Foundation, for help in producing the video; and Dr Tade Thompson from Solent NHS Trust, for his guidance during the conceptualisation stage of this research.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Oakley Cheung</bold> is a psychology student at the Department of Psychology, University of Portsmouth, UK; <bold>Marc Baker</bold> is a lecturer at the Department of Psychology, University of Portsmouth, UK; <bold>Paul Tabraham</bold> is Consultant Clinical Psychologist and Divisional Lead for Psychological Therapies at the Portsmouth and South East Hampshire Division, Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK</p></notes><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec-das"><title>Data availability</title><p>This study was preregistered on 6 November 2019 on the Open Science Framework.
