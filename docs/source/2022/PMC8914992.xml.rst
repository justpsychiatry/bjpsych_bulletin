   .. rubric:: Aim and Method
      :name: sec_a1

   To determine the effect on decisional-related and clinical outcomes
   of decision aids for depression treatment in adults in randomised
   clinical trials. In January 2019, a systematic search was conducted
   in five databases. Study selection and data extraction were performed
   in duplicate. Meta-analyses were performed, and standardised and
   weighted mean differences were calculated, with corresponding 95%
   confidence intervals. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated
   with GRADE methodology.

   .. rubric:: Results
      :name: sec_a2

   Six randomised clinical trials were included. The pooled estimates
   showed that decision aids for depression treatment had a beneficial
   effect on patients’ decisional conflict, patient knowledge and
   information exchange between patient and health professional.
   However, no statistically significant effect was found for doctor
   facilitation, treatment adherence or depressive symptoms. The
   certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes.

   .. rubric:: Clinical implications
      :name: sec_a3

   Using decision aids to choose treatment in patients with depression
   may have a a beneficial effect on decisional-related outcomes, but it
   may not translate into an improvement in clinical outcomes.

Depression and decision-making
==============================

Depression is the most frequent psychiatric disorder and the third most
frequent cause of disability-adjusted life-years.\ :sup:`1,2` The
majority of patients with depression are eligible to receive treatment,
which includes different psychological and pharmacological
interventions\ :sup:`3,4` that seem to have similar
efficacy.\ :sup:`5,6` However, patients with depression frequently have
low access\ :sup:`7` and adherence to depression treatment.\ :sup:`8`

Patients with depression want to receive more information about their
disorder, and participate in their health-related
decisions.\ :sup:`9,10` In this sense, shared decision-making is an
approach for patient-centred care that seeks to actively involve
patients in the decision-making process of choosing between two or more
medically acceptable and evidence-based treatment options.\ :sup:`11` It
is hypothesised that active patient involvement empowers the patient and
could improve treatment adherence and satisfaction rates, which may
result in better treatment effectiveness.\ :sup:`12–14`

.. _sec1-2:

Decision aids in depression
===========================

Decision aids are the main tools used to facilitate shared
decision-making and support patients in making informed
choices.\ :sup:`15` These materials are developed in different formats
(paper, video, web-based tools, etc.), and describe the condition and
the benefits and harms of each treatment option, and encourage patients
to identify which outcomes are the most important for them when making a
choice.\ :sup:`16,17` Usually, these interventions have to be adapted
according to specific population needs, considering the context of their
application.\ :sup:`18` The decision aids mainly seek to improve patient
knowledge, decisional conflict and patient–clinician
communication.\ :sup:`19` Additionally, they have also been studied to
explore their clinical effects, such as treatment adherence\ :sup:`20`
or reduction of symptoms.\ :sup:`21`

Although the use of decision aids may cause benefits such as higher
treatment adherence and, therefore, higher clinical improvement, it may
also cause harm, such as an increased level of patient
stress.\ :sup:`22` In addition, people with major depressive disorder
could have abnormal decision-making behaviour in a social interaction
context because of an altered sensitivity for reward and punishment,
reduce experiences of regret and poor decision performance.\ :sup:`23`
This situation could also affect the use of decision aids in patients
with depression.

Regarding decision aids for depression treatment, there is still concern
about the benefit–harm balance, although some studies have assessed
their effects. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to search for
randomised clinical trials (RCTs) to assess the effects of decision aids
on the shared decision process and clinical outcomes in adults with
depression.

Method
======

The protocol for this systematic review has been registered with the
International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO;
identifier CRD42019121878). This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Human Medicine Faculty of Ricardo Palma University
(CE-8-2019).

.. _sec2-1:

Literature search and study selection
-------------------------------------

For this systematic review, we included all RCTs that included adults
with any type of depression. These RCTs must have compared a group that
received a decision aid that aimed to help patients decide about their
treatment for any kind of depression treatment (as a stand-alone
intervention, or as the main element within a complex intervention) with
a group that did not, and directly assessed any beneficial or adverse
effects in adults with depression. We excluded RCTs that had as
population only pregnant women because they have different risks that
should be considered when deciding whether to use
antidepressants.\ :sup:`24` Also, we excluded conference papers. There
were no restrictions on language or publication date.

Decision aids were defined as tools or technologies used to help
patients make informed decisions by offering information about treatment
options, and help them to construct, clarify and communicate their
values and preferences.\ :sup:`25` However, sometimes it is difficult to
differentiate from other information-based interventions.\ :sup:`26` To
define if the proposed intervention was a decision aid, we used the
six-item qualifying criteria for decision aids developed by the
International Patient Decision Aid Standards Collaboration, as it
provides the definition standards for decision aids: (a) describes the
health condition or problem for which the index decision is required,
(b) states the decision that needs to be considered, (c) describes the
options available for the index decision, (d) describes the positive
features of each option, (e) describes the negative features of each
option and (f) describes what it is like to experience the consequences
of the options.\ :sup:`27`

The decision aid assessed by the RCTs needed to meet all six criteria to
be included in our systematic review.

A literature search was performed in two steps: a systematic review of
five databases, and a review of all documents cited by any of the
studies included in the first step. For the first step, we performed a
literature search in five databases: Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of
Science and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used terms related to decision
support, decision aid, decision-making, depression and clinical trials.
The complete search strategies for each database are available in
Supplementary File 1 available at https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.130.
The last update of this database search was performed on 5 January 2019.
Duplicated records were removed with EndNote version X8 for Windows
(Clarivate Analytics, Thomson Reuters, New York; see
https://endnote.com/). After that, titles and abstracts were
independently screened by two pairs of independent reviewers (C.A.A.-R.
with M.E.D.-B., and N.B.-C. with C.J.T.-H.) to identify potentially
relevant articles for inclusion. This was performed with the online
software Rayyan version 01 for Windows (Qatar Computing Research
Institute, Qatar Foundation, Qatar; see
https://rayyan.qcri.org).\ :sup:`28` Disagreements were resolved through
a discussion with a third reviewer (J.H.Z.-T.). Then, the full text of
potentially relevant articles were assessed to evaluate their
eligibility. This process was also independently performed by two
researchers. The complete list of excluded articles at this full-text
stage is available in Supplementary File 2.

For the second step, two independent reviewers (M.E.D.-B. and N.B.-C.)
assessed all documents listed in the references section of the studies
selected in the first step, and collected all articles that fulfilled
the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

.. _sec2-2:

Data extraction
---------------

Two independent researchers (C.A.A.-R. and M.E.D.-B.) extracted the
following information from each of the included studies into a sheet of
Microsoft Excel version 2018 for Windows: author, year of publication,
title, population (inclusion and exclusion criteria), setting,
intervention (name, type, the methodology of application and length of
use), comparator (name, type, the methodology of application and length
of use), time of follow-up and effects of decision aid in all included
outcomes.

Intervention information was collected with the Template for
Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist.\ :sup:`29`
The checklist originally was designed for pharmacological interventions;
thus, we included only the following items, adapted for more complex
interventions: name of intervention, rationale, location of delivery,
materials, procedures, who provided, modes of delivery (grouped or
individual), frequency (sessions) and possible options to choose within
the decision aid. In case of disagreement, the full-text article was
reviewed again by the researchers, to reach a consensus.

.. _sec2-3:

Study quality and certainty of the evidence
-------------------------------------------

Two independent researchers (C.A.A.-R. and N.B.-C.) used the Cochrane
Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs to assess systematic errors (or bias) in the
design, conduct, analysis and reporting of the RCT that could
potentially underestimate or overestimate the results.\ :sup:`30` We
followed the instructions stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions and evaluated selection bias, performance bias,
detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias to assess each of the
six domains of the tool as low, high or unclear risk of bias, by each
RCT included in the systematic review.\ :sup:`31`

To assess the certainty of the evidence, we used the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
methodology,\ :sup:`32` which classifies it in a very low, low, moderate
or high certainty of the evidence each outcome in the systematic review.
This classification is based on the following criteria: risk of bias
(evaluated through the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool), inconsistency
(heterogeneity between the RCT results and in terms of population,
intervention, comparator and outcome; additionally assessed by the
*I*\ :sup:`2` test), indirectness (how different are the included RCTs
to the question of interest) and imprecision (wideness of the confidence
interval). The certainty of the evidence was assessed for all
meta-analysed outcomes and non-meta-analysed outcomes that were
important for decision- making. Additionally, when two or more RCTs
assessed the same outcome, but a meta-analysis was not performed, we
summarised the individual data of each RCT narratively, and then
assessed the certainty of the evidence following the recommendations
proposed by Murad et al.\ :sup:`33`

.. _sec2-4:

Statistical analyses
--------------------

We performed meta-analyses to summarise the results of the RCTs that
evaluated the same outcomes. When outcomes were measured with different
scales across studies, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMD)
to compare and meta-analyse these studies; otherwise, we calculated
weighted mean differences (WMD). For outcomes that had been measured
more than once, we only considered the final measurement to perform the
meta-analyses, as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook.\ :sup:`31` We
assessed heterogeneity with the *I*\ :sup:`2` statistic, and we
considered that heterogeneity might not be significant when
*I*\ :sup:`2` < 40%.\ :sup:`31` We considered it appropriate to use
random-effects models in all the meta-analysis because of the overall
heterogeneity in terms of population, intervention and
comparators.\ :sup:`34` We executed a sensitivity analysis, taking into
account contradictory results within studies. We did not considerer to
exclude studies with high risk for bias for sensitivity analysis,
because all the included RCTs had at least one domain of the Cochrane
Risk of Bias Tool with a high risk of bias. Also, we did not execute a
subgroup analysis because of the low number of studies by each
meta-analysis. Publication bias was not statistically assessed because
the number of studies pooled for each meta-analysis was less than
ten.\ :sup:`35` The data were processed with Stata version 15.0 for
Windows.

Studies characteristics
-----------------------

We found a total of 3309 titles. We removed 804 duplicates and screened
a total of 2505 titles, of which 41 were evaluated in full text. Of
these, 35 were excluded (reasons for exclusion are detailed in
Supplementary File 2) and six were included.\ :sup:`17,36–40`
Additionally, we evaluated 255 documents cited by any of the six
included studies, from which no additional study was included (`Fig.
1 <#fig01>`__). Fig. 1Flow diagram (study selection). RCT, randomised
controlled trial.

.. _sec3-2:

Patient characteristics
-----------------------

In the included RCTs, the number of participants ranged from 147 to
1137. Regarding the study setting, three studies were performed in
primary care centres,\ :sup:`17,38,39` one in out-patient
clinics\ :sup:`37` and two were performed remotely (one intervention was
sent by mail to the participants\ :sup:`36` and one was an online
intervention\ :sup:`40`). With regards to depression diagnosis for
inclusion criteria, two studies used the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9,\ :sup:`38,39` one study used the DSM-IV,\ :sup:`37` one
study used the DSM-IV and the ICD-10,\ :sup:`17` one used self-report
criteria\ :sup:`40` and another did not specify the diagnosis
criteria.\ :sup:`36` Also, only one study specified the severity of
depression according to the inclusion criteria.\ :sup:`38`
Characteristics of each included study are available in Supplementary
File 3.

.. _sec3-3:

Interventions and comparators
-----------------------------

Interventions were heterogeneous across studies; four studies used
visual decision aid (leaflets, booklet, cards or DVD),\ :sup:`36–39` and
two studies used a computer-based decision aid (webpage or artificial
intelligence).\ :sup:`17,40` Regarding the decision aid application: in
two studies, physicians applied the decision aids,\ :sup:`38,39` in two
studies the decision aids were self-applied,\ :sup:`17,36` in one study
the decision aids were applied by a pharmacist\ :sup:`37` and in one
study decision aids were applied by artificial intelligence.\ :sup:`40`
All decision aids presented possible options regarding the patient's
depression treatment. Specifically, four decision aids presented options
for the of use antidepressant drugs, psychotherapy/psychological
treatment or watchful waiting.\ :sup:`17,37,39,40` Furthermore, two
decision aids presented options for start, stop, increase or switch
antidepressant treatment.\ :sup:`36,38` Intervention's characteristics
are detailed in Supplementary File 4, using the TIDieR checklist.
Regarding the control group, in five studies, participants received
either usual care or no intervention, and in the remaining study, the
decision aid was compared with an informative intervention.\ :sup:`40`

.. _sec3-4:

Outcomes
--------

Included RCTs assessed a wide variety of outcomes, including
decision-making process outcomes, such as decisional conflict,
information exchange, patient knowledge, patients involvement in
decision-making, decision regret, etc. Decisional conflict is known as
the degree of patient insecurity about possible consequences that occur
after deciding their health,\ :sup:`41` and information exchange assess
the communication between doctor and patient about their illness and its
management when there is a need to decide on patient's
health.\ :sup:`42` Additionally, there are also clinical outcomes (such
as depressive symptoms, adverse effects, treatment adherence and
health-related quality of life). All the measured outcomes and
definitions, by each RCT, are presented in `Table 1 <#tab01>`__. Table

Risk of bias
------------

Regarding the risk of bias, mostly all RCTs detailed random sequence and
allocation concealment. Two RCTs presented a high risk of attrition bias
because they some participants were lost to follow-up. Furthermore,
three RCTs had an unclear risk of bias for selective reporting. All six
RCTs failed to blind the outcome assessment, and five RCTs failed to
blind personnel and participants (`Fig. 2 <#fig02>`__). Fig. 2Risk of
bias in the selected studies.

.. _sec3-6:

Effects on decision-making process outcomes
-------------------------------------------

When pooling the RCTs, we found that decision aids had a beneficial
effect on information exchange (two RCTs; WMD 2.02; 95% CI 1.11–2.93),
patient knowledge (four RCTs; SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.14–1.15) and decisional
conflict, which refers to patient insecurity about the possible
consequences that occur after deciding their health (three RCTs; WMD
−5.93; 95% CI −11.24 to −0.61). Additionally, we found no statistically
significant effect on doctor facilitation (two RCTs; WMD 1.40; 95% CI
−4.37 to 7.18).

Regarding the outcome of patient involvement in the decision-making
process, two RCTs present their results for this outcome, but each of
them used a different instrument and perspective of assessment. Loh et
al\ :sup:`39` used the Man-Son-Hing scale (patient perspective) and
found a statistical difference between study groups (mean difference
2.5; 95% CI 1.6–3.4). Alternatively, LeBlanc et al\ :sup:`38` used the
Observing Patient Involvement in Decision-Making scale (evaluator
perspective), and also found a statistical difference between study
groups (mean difference 15.8; 95% CI 6.5–25.9).

The remaining decision-making process outcomes were assessed only by one
RCT, and we did not find differences between the study groups in terms
of length of consultation,\ :sup:`39` decisional control preference
(between passive, active or shared)\ :sup:`17` and decision
regret.\ :sup:`40` However, we found a beneficial effect to be sure of
the intention to choose a treatment (sure or not sure),\ :sup:`17` in
the treatment satisfaction,\ :sup:`37` in the decision aid
satisfaction\ :sup:`38` and the preparation of patients for
decision-making.\ :sup:`40`

.. _sec3-7:

Effects on clinical outcomes
----------------------------

We did not find beneficial effect on treatment adherence (three RCTs;
SMD 0.20; 95% CI −0.31 to 0.71), and depressive symptoms (three RCTs;
SMD −0.06; 95% CI −0.22 to 0.09) (`Fig. 3 <#fig03>`__). Also, one RCT
evaluated one adverse effect, mortality, and reported no adverse effects
in both intervention and control arms,\ :sup:`36` and another one found
no differences between study groups for health-related quality of
life.\ :sup:`37` Fig. 3(a) Forest plot of decision aid for decisional

standardized mean differences; WMD, weighted mean differences.

.. _sec3-8:

Sensitivity analysis
--------------------

Three of the performed meta-analyses had important heterogeneity
(*I*\ :sup:`2` > 40). Of these, only the meta-analysis performed for
treatment adherence (three RCTs; SMD 0.20; 95% CI −0.31 to 0.71)
included studies with contradictory results. Thus, we executed a
sensitivity analysis for this outcome, excluding the RCT by Simon et
al,\ :sup:`40` because its results contradicted the other results of the
two RCTs by Loh et al and Aljumah et al.\ :sup:`37,39` The global effect
of this sensitivity analysis, with only two RCTs, was an SMD of 0.50
(95% CI 0.29–0.70).

.. _sec3-9:

Certainty of evidence
---------------------

| We created a Summary of Findings table, using the GRADE methodology to
  assess the certainty of evidence. For this, we included those outcomes
  that were considered important for the patient and/or their
  practitioner. We found that the evidence for all these outcomes was of
  very low certainty, mainly because of high risk of bias, inconsistency
  and imprecision of RCTs (`Table 2 <#tab02>`__). Table 2Summary of

Discussion
==========

We included six RCTs that evaluated the effects of decision aid in
adults with depression. These studies were heterogeneous, had small
sample sizes and presented with a high risk of bias. When pooling the
RCTs, we found benefits in some outcomes such as decisional conflict,
patient knowledge and information exchange, but not in clinical outcomes
such as depression symptoms or treatment adherence. All of the outcomes
included in the Summary of Findings table had very low certainty of
evidence.

The interventions used in the six included RCTs fulfilled all the
qualifying items from the International Patient Decision Aid Standards
Collaboration criteria.\ :sup:`27` However, there was heterogeneity
regarding the type of decision aids used (including leaflets, booklets,
cards, DVD, a webpage or artificial intelligence), treatment options in
the decision aids and by whom they were administered (physicians,
pharmacists, researchers or the patient themselves). This heterogeneity
is expected because the use of the decision aids largely depends on
context, and has to be adapted according to population needs.\ :sup:`18`
However, the fact that there were not even two studies that used the
same decision aid affects the capability of synthesis and interpretation
of the pooled results.\ :sup:`43`

Regarding the quality of the included RCTs, participants were not
blinded because of the intervention's intrinsic nature. This represents
an important source of bias as the perception of subjective outcomes
could have been influenced.\ :sup:`44` Additionally, most RCTs used a
no-intervention group as the control without placebo. However, using an
information-based intervention about treatment options for depression
without a decision-making process as a control group in the RCTs would
have helped to prevent the complex intervention effects, and ensure that
the effects of the decision aid are not explained only by higher
attention from a health professional.\ :sup:`45`

Regarding the effects of decision aid, our pooled estimates suggest no
effect in clinical outcomes, as described by a previous review that
assessed decision aid in patients with mood disorders and found no
effect with depressive symptoms,\ :sup:`46` and by another systematic
review that assessed decision aid for screening tests and found no
effect in treatment adherence.\ :sup:`47` These results could be
explained by a linear and logical sequence that we propose. First, the
decision aid gives the information to the patient about depression and
its treatment options, which explains the ‘knowledge’ improvement. Then,
the patients are more capable of discussing the disease and their
treatment options with the health professional, which explains the
‘information exchange’ improvement. Later, the patient feels capable of
making a choice, which explains the decrease in ‘decisional conflict’.
After making a choice, the patients receive their treatment and feel
satisfied with their decision, which improves the ‘sure of the intention
to choose a treatment’, the ‘treatment satisfaction’ and the ‘decision
aid satisfaction’. Lastly, it would be expected that all of these
achievements are translated into clinical outcomes: a higher treatment
adherence and subsequent reduction of depressive symptoms.

However, regarding this last point, other factors could influence
clinical outcomes. Adherence could be affected by accessibility to the
treatment, the way the patients perceive the effectiveness of the
treatment, severity of the disease, etc.\ :sup:`48` Additionally,
depressive symptoms could be affected by the treatment adherence itself,
the adequacy of the chosen treatment for the clinical characteristics of
the patient and other psychosocial factors.\ :sup:`49` In addition, some
methodological issues could explain the results. None of the studies
included in the meta-analysis of depressive symptoms, and only one of
the three studies included in the meta-analysis of treatment adherence
were designed to assess those outcomes, so there could have been a lack
of power to find a difference between study groups.

The pooled analysis found no effect of decision aids on treatment
adherence (SMD −0.31 to 0.71). This meta-analysis included three
RCTs.\ :sup:`37,39,40` One of them\ :sup:`40` contradicted the results
of the other two, in addition to having the smallest sample size and the
highest risk of bias (as a result of attrition bias and small sample
size). Thus, a sensitivity analysis removing that RCT found a beneficial
effect of decision aids for treatment adherence (SMD 0.50; 95% CI
0.29–0.70). Thus, we cannot exclude a possible positive effect of
decision aids on treatment adherence, which has to be assessed in future
studies.

On the other hand, we did find beneficial effects in decision-making
process outcomes, such as decisional conflict, information exchange and
patient knowledge, similar to a previous review.\ :sup:`46` These three
outcomes are expected for a decision aid designed to facilitate the
shared decision-making process. Five\ :sup:`17,36–38,40` out of six RCTs
assessed decision aids developed to enhance patients’ involvement in the
decision-making process, support their choices, empower them and improve
their knowledge about their therapeutic options. Consequently, the
decision aid's main objective may determine the outcomes (decision
process or clinical outcomes) it will affect. Future studies assessing
decision aid clinical outcomes must assess a decision aid specially
designed to improve clinical outcomes, such as treatment adherence,
depressive symptoms and quality of life.

Altogether, our results suggest that the use of a decision aid in
patients with depression may have an effect on knowledge, information
and decision-related outcomes. However, its effect on adherence is
doubtful, and there seems to be no effect on depressive symptoms.
Although we found a very low certainty of the evidence, stakeholders are
needed to decide in this regard. Healthcare institutions must consider
the costs, acceptability and applicability of this intervention in their
context. Additionally, healthcare professionals must consider the
balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of the decision
aid's application, and acknowledge the patient information and
involvement as decisive components for the shared decision-making
process,\ :sup:`50,51` to make a decision applicable to each particular
patient.

Limitations and strengths
-------------------------

Our study included a small number of heterogeneous studies. However, we
decided to conduct a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis about the
overall effect of decision aid in patients with depression, for a better
decision-making process.\ :sup:`43` The certainty of the evidence was
very low for all the prioritised outcomes, which demonstrates the need
for more well-designed and adequately reported RCTs with higher sample
sizes.

On the other hand, this systematic review has important strengths: it
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses statement and was inscribed in the PROSPERO database.
Also, we performed a comprehensive search strategy across multiple
databases, without language restriction, and across articles that cited
each of the found studies, which allowed us to find all studies reported
in previous systematic reviews\ :sup:`46,47` and other studies that were
not found in these reviews. Lastly, we evaluated the certainty of
evidence with the GRADE methodology.

In conclusion, we found six RCTs that evaluated the effects of decision
aid in adults with depression. Evidence of very low certainty suggests
that decision aids may have benefits in decisional conflict, patient
knowledge and information exchange, but not in clinical outcomes
(treatment adherence and depression symptoms). More RCTs are needed to
adequately assess the effects of decision aids in patients with
depression.
