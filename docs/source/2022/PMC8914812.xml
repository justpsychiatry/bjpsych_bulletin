It manages a mixed population of remand and short-term sentenced prisoners and those serving longer sentences, including a significant number serving life or indeterminate sentences. The turnover is high (approximately 70 receptions per week) and psychiatric morbidity is common.</p><p>Women in prison are five times more likely to have a mental health problem than women in the general population, with 78% exhibiting some kind of psychological disturbance on reception according to the 12-item General Health Questionnaire.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A study of remanded prisoners found 11% to be acutely psychotic on reception.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>At any one time, the mental health team in HMP Low Newton provides support to about a third of the population, about a quarter of whom have complex mental health needs.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The team conducts triage assessments for approximately 20 new patients each week. There are three sessions of clinical input from a psychiatrist, which, given the constraints on access to prisoners, amounts to approximately 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h direct clinical contact per week. There are no other prescribers within the team. Primary care services are provided by an independent organisation, G4S Healthcare.</p><p>Antipsychotics are potent drugs, primarily licensed for the management of schizophrenia, mania and other severe psychotic disorders. They have the potential to cause a wide range of acute and long-term side-effects, some of which can be serious, including parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, obesity, diabetes, cardiotoxicity, sudden death, hormonal changes, electrolyte imbalances, convulsions and blood dyscrasias.</p><p>Although they can also be prescribed in both psychiatric and general practice for the relief of stress, anxiety and psychological distress, those licensed for this purpose, which include chlorpromazine, olanzapine and haloperidol, should only be used in the short term. There is no evidence that antipsychotics have any demonstrable long-term benefit in the management of personality disorders.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Despite this, off-label prescribing is increasingly common and has been identified as a cause for concern.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>There is a growing body of literature highlighting the misuse potential of some antipsychotic medications, particularly quetiapine.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> There is also increasing awareness of the risks of harm from misuse and diversion of prescribed medicines in prison. These extend beyond the effects of the drugs themselves to include bullying, threats and coercion, and debt.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Deaths from the misuse of prescribed drugs, including antipsychotics, are rising. The numbers of deaths caused by antipsychotics in 2017 saw an increase of just over 5% from 2016, which equates to a rate of 2.1 per 1 million population.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>Aims/objectives</title><p>The purpose of this review was to ascertain whether the prescription of antipsychotic medication in HMP Low Newton was safe, rational and consistent with current best practice.

A search of the electronic healthcare records was performed on 14 March 2018 to identify all the women in the prison who were being prescribed antipsychotic medication on that day.

Therefore, any antipsychotic prescription that met this criterion was defined as &#x02018;off label&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec4"><title>Results</title><p>The prison roll for that day was 336.

The majority of patients were reviewed by the mental health team with 7 days of reception and had prior or planed appointments with the psychiatrist to review their medication.</p><p>The review highlighted a high rate of off-label prescriptions for antipsychotic medication within the prison. The study confirmed that this was particularly the case with quetiapine, which, given the high rates of misuse of this drug within the prison, is of concern. Although there was no clear reason for this, one can speculate that, owing to the high number of female prisoners reporting difficulties with &#x02018;mood&#x02019; and &#x02018;voices&#x02019;, quetiapine is chosen because of its reported benefits in relation to &#x02018;mood stabilisation&#x02019;, as well as its antipsychotic effects. There is also, however, a likelihood that this medication is often requested by the prisoners for its &#x02018;tradeable&#x02019; status and potential for misuse.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>There is a high rate of polypharmacy in relation to psychotropic medication, which can increase the risk of side-effects and physical health complications. All but two of the patients were prescribed no more than three psychotropic agents. Again, this is likely to be due in part to a high rate of comorbid substance misuse within the prison population. Furthermore, there is a tendency for patients to prefer medication over alternative treatments such as psychological intervention.</p><p>Psychological therapies are identified as the primary treatment for patients with personality disorder.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> At HMP Low Newton, a variety of psychological services are available. These include the 12-bedded Primrose Unit, for women with severe personality disorder, which forms part of the Offender Personality Disorder Pathway, and a Psychologically Informed Planned Environment wing. The prison forensic psychology services offer a range of assessments and treatments, and the scope of this work is driven by consultancy with offender management units and offender managers within the community. Finally, there is the prison mental health team, who work in line with trauma-informed care principles and can offer a range of individual and group therapies. However, there is often a waiting list for such services, and potentially suitable prisoners often do not remain within the prison long enough to start and complete identified treatments before release or transfer.</p><p>Although a large proportion of the prescriptions were issued by a psychiatrist, it is noted that approximately half were commenced in either in the community or during a different prison sentence. Therefore, it is possible that some patients are reissued prescriptions without a thorough review of need, current mental state and other prescribed treatments. Also, the records indicate that often little consideration is given to whether the patient has adhered to medication in the community and so, often, this is simply re-prescribed if it is on the GP summary. The guidelines in relation to use of antipsychotic medications for minor symptoms, such as anxiety, stress or agitation, are clear that it should be a short-term measure only. However, such prescriptions are often continued for prolonged periods without a critical review. This tendency may be exacerbated in the prison population by transfers to other establishments, early release, failures to engage with the mental health team, and a relative lack of attention paid to the initial timing and indications for prescribing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec7"><title>Recommendations</title><p>

The presumption should be that medications for these reasons should only be prescribed in the short term, and this should be clearly explained to the patient.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Care should also be taken with patients who have a history of substance misuse, or of secreting and hoarding medication, as this often indicates involvement in trading.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If patients have not adhered to antipsychotic medication in the community, then it should not be automatically re-prescribed on reception without review by the mental health team or psychiatrist.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Prescriptions for quetiapine should be kept under regular review and withdrawn unless there are clear reasons for continuing to prescribe.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This review should be repeated after a year to assess the effects of these measures on off-label prescribing.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Lois Carey</bold> is a consultant forensic psychiatrist at Roseberry Park Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK. <bold>Stephen Barlow</bold> is a consultant forensic psychiatrist at Roseberry Park Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK.</p></notes><notes id="nts2" notes-type="other"><title>Author contributions</title><p>L.C. had a substantial role in the design of the study, acquisition and analysis of the data, and drafting and revising the work.
