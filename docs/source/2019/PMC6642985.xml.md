title: Effects of suicide on psychiatry trainees
---

We read with interest the survey by Gibbons *et al*^1^ and welcomed the
idea of examining what kind of support may help clinicians deal with
this difficult aspect of mental health practice.

It is interesting to note how some responses to the survey indicated
that having experienced a patient suicide as a trainee had a significant
influence on the responder\'s choice of subspecialty. This finding
highlights how junior doctors, whether in a formal training programme or
not, are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of a patient
suicide, with potential effects on recruitment and retainment in
psychiatry.

In our mental health trust in South East London, trainee-led initiatives
in collaboration with the postgraduate training department have been
making changes to the learning and support offered to junior doctors who
are involved in a serious incident investigation in the past 5 years.^2^
The projects involve annual events to promote knowledge and discussion
about quality and safety; discussions about the process of serious
incident investigations and the support available at each junior doctor
induction; and the development of a written resource on formal and
informal sources of support for junior doctors involved in a serious
incident investigation. These projects are under constant review in
order to respond to trainee feedback.

We thank the authors for the valuable work exploring how suicide can
affect doctors of any grade. We hope that mental health trusts and
postgraduate training departments continue working to develop formal and
informal support structures for doctors experiencing this difficult
event.
