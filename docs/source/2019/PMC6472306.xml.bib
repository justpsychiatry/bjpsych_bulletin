I note with interest the initiative by Buick *et al* to evaluate a
peer-led workshop on suturing skills for doctors working in psychiatric
hospitals.\ :sup:`1`

The authors describe improved confidence of doctors with regards to
suturing, associated with a reduction in transfers to accident and
emergency (A&E) departments and a significant potential cost saving
(calculated at £183.76 for each transfer that is avoided). It would be
interesting to learn whether the intervention was associated with any
change in the frequency of self-harm on the psychiatric wards.

Albert *et al* make important comments on the benefits for doctors in
continuing to apply their basic medical skills in this context, and
point to a cognitive–analytic model to describe role reciprocity in the
case of self-harming patients having interventions for their wounds. It
would be interesting to investigate further how in-house physical
treatment may differ from A&E treatment concerning rescuer-to-rescued
roles and reinforcement.

I would like to suggest that the decision to provide physical treatments
(including suturing) – or the decision not to do so – will have an
effect on the overall treating relationship and treatment frame.

What does it mean for a patient who expresses distress or hostility
through cutting, when the doctor tasked with treating their
psychological difficulties also becomes involved in the physically
intimate act of suturing their body? How are the doctor's own emotional
responses towards the patient's self-harm and the subsequent restorative
procedure registered and managed when the doctor either performs the
procedure directly, or sends the patient to A&E?

Perhaps these complex emotional factors could also be worked out in peer
groups – in particular through Balint or other psychological case-based
discussion groups.
