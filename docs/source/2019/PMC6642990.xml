Several authorities have suggested that changing the name, for example to psychosis, would reduce such stigmatisation. We aimed to compare attitudes to schizophrenia and psychosis on Twitter to see if psychosis was associated with less negative attitudes. Tweets containing the terms &#x02018;schizophrenia&#x02019;, &#x02018;schizophrenic&#x02019;, &#x02018;psychosis&#x02019; or &#x02018;psychotic&#x02019; were collected on <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.twitter.com">www.twitter.com</uri> and were captured with NCapture.

Our figure of 9.35% (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;424) falls in between what these two studies found. The difference in the percentage of schizophrenia tweets rated as stigmatising at different times could reflect coding differences but may be because of the effect of short-term changes in discussions about schizophrenia on Twitter.</p><p>There is some literature on the stigmatisation of schizophrenia and psychosis in entertainment media. A content analysis of Finnish and Greek videos on YouTube found that 83% of 52 videos portrayed schizophrenia in a negative way.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Similarly, Nour <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> found that most videos presenting schizophrenia on YouTube inaccurately portray the condition. Goodwin<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> examined the stereotyping of characters experiencing psychosis in 33 psychosis-related horror films released before the study was conducted. He concluded that 78.8% portrayed a homicidal maniac and 72.7% portrayed a pathetic or sad character. This is in keeping with our finding that psychosis is heavily stigmatised.</p><p>News media are also a focal point for the stigmatisation of mental health conditions. Vilhauer<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> analysed 181 USA newspaper articles mentioning the auditory verbal hallucinations that are diagnostic features of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. They found that about 50% of the articles associated auditory verbal hallucinations with criminal behaviour and violence. These findings are broadly in keeping with a more recent study that concluded that over half of all UK newspaper articles about mental health (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;200) are negative and 18.5% indicate an association with violence.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The main strength of this study is its ability to assess peoples&#x02019; uncensored views about schizophrenia and psychosis without the need of a survey, the results from which could be affected by social desirability bias. The nature of Twitter means that, once published, a tweet is accessible to anyone without further permission from the tweet's author. Relevant tweets were easy to access on <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.twitter.com">www.twitter.com</uri> with the advanced search tool and the process of coding was relatively time-efficient and simple using NVivo.</p><p>There are, however, a few limitations of this study. First, capturing data for two arbitrarily chosen 7-day periods means that external events and news cycles may have affected the way people discuss schizophrenia and psychosis, perhaps reducing the generalisability of the data. Of note, there were news stories about USA's response to North Korean nuclear missile testing in the April 2017 observation period,<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and September 2017's period was soon after a bomb injured 30 people in London, England.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> A further study could look in detail about how news media and current affairs influence people's expression of mental illness on social media. A longer period of study could examine detail how current affairs influence people's discussion of mental illness on social media, and potentially highlight trends in how people discuss schizophrenia and psychosis.</p><p>Another limitation is that spelling mistakes, abbreviations and colloquial terms for the searched terms may be used in tweets. By searching for only &#x02018;schizophrenia, &#x02018;schizophrenic&#x02019;, &#x02018;psychosis&#x02019; and &#x02018;psychotic&#x02019;, tweets containing mistakes, abbreviations and colloquial terms will not have been captured in the search. We decided not to include abbreviations and colloquial terms in the search because it may not be clear whether tweets would actually have been about schizophrenia and psychosis. An example would be the abbreviation &#x02018;psycho&#x02019;, which could refer to psychopath, rather than psychosis. However, if anything, it is more likely that spelling mistakes, abbreviations and colloquial terms may have higher rates of stigmatisation. In a similar vein, future studies could map the different definitions of schizophrenia/c and psychosis/tic used by lay individuals and professionals as this may influence the degree of stigmatising attitudes.</p><p>Both the 7-day window convenience sampling and the ability of users to privatise their Twitter accounts could have contributed to selection bias within the study. Content from private accounts would not be visible to our searches, and it would be an interesting but technically challenging study to assess whether private and public accounts have different levels of stigma. Selection bias is an often-encountered issue when conducting research on internet-based communications, and although an attempt to mitigate this was made by analysing all tweets from within the time frame, this may reduce the external validity of the conclusions.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p><p>Finally, this study only looked on <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.twitter.com">www.twitter.com</uri> and there are other social media platforms that could be assessed. Facebook data may be hard to access as the average person is likely to have their profile on a private setting, but it would be interesting to see if psychosis content on YouTube is as negative and inaccurate as it is for schizophrenia. Future work could also compare the stigmatisation of different psychoses on Twitter and other social media.</p><p>In conclusion, on Twitter, psychosis is more stigmatised than schizophrenia. This suggests that the term psychosis should not be used if schizophrenia is to be renamed with the aim of reducing stigma. Further, given that different psychotic disorders have particular treatments and varying prognoses,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> such a move to a more generic term may do more harm than good.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Giorgianna L.
