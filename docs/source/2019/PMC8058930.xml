The study received ethical approval as a service evaluation from the East London NHS Foundation Trust because the process did not involve any additional data collection or patient contact.</p><p>In this retrospective case series, we reviewed HoNOS and DIALOG data from successive patients admitted to the THCH at both admission and discharge (two-point data), between June 2015 and December 2016. Data were collected from quarterly reports submitted as a part of quarterly reporting. To avoid double-counting, e.g. in patient episodes that spread over more than one quarter, data were reconciled to ensure patients who were admitted and discharged over two different quarters were identified as single patients and double-counting was therefore avoided.</p><p>For the analysis, the authors compared HoNOS (CROM) and DIALOG (PROM) ratings at admission and discharge. Therefore, we did not analyse the three patient-reported experience measures in the DIALOG intervention (questions 9&#x02013;11). This study did not assess domain four (cognitive problems) of the HoNOS, as most of the patients presenting to the THCH did not have cognitive difficulties. We also decided not to assess domain eight of the HoNOS intervention (other mental and behavioural problems: specify A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I or J, where A is phobic, B is anxiety, C is obsessive&#x02013;compulsive, D is mental strain/tension, E is dissociative, F is somatoform, G is eating, H is sleep, I is sexual and J is other, specify) because of the heterogeneity of conditions that are assessed in this domain.

Among those for whom two-point DIALOG data were unavailable (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;68): 47 customers did not complete the discharge PROM but had a planned discharge, 6 customers did not complete the discharge PROM as they were either admitted to hospital or abandoned occupancy, and for 15 patients there was no admission or discharge DIALOG score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Two-point and one-point HoNOS data were available for 91 (59.5%) and 62 patients (40.5%), respectively. There was &#x0003e;85% matching in the cohort of patients who completed the two-point DIALOG and HoNOS interventions. For HoNOS scores, we show a statistically significant improvement in nine out of ten assessed domains, where domain five (physical illness or disability problems) was the only outcome that did not reach statistical significance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Among the eight DIALOG scores assessed in this analysis, we show a statistically significant improvement in domains one (mental health), five (leisure activities) and eight (personal safety) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Comparing similar domains in the HoNOS and DIALOG (see <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we show some degree of mirroring in the clinician and patient responses, although there is some discrepancy, e.g. comparison numbers four, seven, nine and ten.

The Five Year Forward View for Mental Health stresses the importance of funding psychiatric services that have transparency around quality and outcomes, and suggested these should be in place by 2017&#x02013;2018 for adult mental health services.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>In recent years, the patient&#x02013;doctor relationship has evolved: from a paternalistic approach to one that is more collaborative with increased respect for patient autonomy.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Given this evolution in the healthcare model, there is increasing recognition of the importance of involving patients in the development and evaluation of healthcare service delivery and quality improvement. PROMs are the tools that have been developed to ensure both a valid and reliable measurement of patient-reported outcomes. PROMs are directly reported by the patient without interpretation of the patient's response by a clinician or anyone else and pertain to the patient's functional status associated with healthcare or treatment.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Capturing both PROM and CROM data in clinical practice provides a more complete understanding of the impact of a healthcare intervention.</p><p>HoNOS is mandated as the nationally recommended generic CROM, to be administered by mental health professionals.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Although HoNOS has been around for 20 years,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> currently no universally agreed methodology for analysing this score exists in the literature.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The DIALOG intervention was developed as part of a multicentre trial developed from Mensa, and then further developed as a solution-focused therapy tool.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The DIALOG intervention is suggested by NHS England as an effective PROM intervention, but there are several alternatives, including the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery and Short Warwick &#x00026; Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The analysis of PROM scores around DIALOG is in its infancy.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report to systematically compare outcomes of the HoNOS and DIALOG interventions in a crisis house and HTT partnership. Given no standardised approach to analyse HoNOS and DIALOG data-sets exists in the literature, we analysed each item in the HoNOS and DIALOG interventions individually to achieve maximum granularity of data, as well as to allow us to compare similar fields in DIALOG and HoNOS, which would permit a degree of triangulation of clinician and patient perspectives. Our study shows that improvement in CROM scores is not always reflected by an improvement in PROM scores.</p><p>It is encouraging that mental health (DIALOG domain one) and personal safety (DIALOG domain eight) &#x02013; the domains in which a mental health crisis service would be expected to have maximum impact &#x02013; both feature statistically significant improvement in PROM scores. This finding is supported by statistically significant improvement in similar CROM scores assessing overactive, aggressive, disrupted or agitated behaviour (HoNOS domain one); overactive, aggressive, disrupted or agitated behaviour (HoNOS domain one); non-accidental self-injury (HoNOS domain two); problem-drinking or drug-taking (HoNOS domain three); problems with hallucinations and delusions (HoNOS domain six) and problems with depressed mood (HoNOS domain seven).</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are four models of community base community-based crisis services:<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> (a) clinical crisis houses, providing residential services with staff onsite through the night and have a high level of clinical staff involved in providing onsite care; (b) specialist crisis houses, which share similar features to clinical crisis houses but are aimed at specific groups such as women and people with early psychosis; (c) crisis team beds, which provide a small number of beds aimed at short stays and are fully integrated with Crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) teams and (d) non-clinical alternatives, which are mainly managed by the voluntary sector with few clinical staff but many have also forged strong links with CRHT teams. Not all crisis houses have the same degree of collaboration with CRHTs, nor do they all offer residential support; for example, the Dial House in Leeds, UK.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The THCH, established in 2010, is a partnership between the voluntary sector provider Look Ahead and East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT). The THCH service is embedded within the HTT, which &#x02018;gate-keeps&#x02019; all admissions to the accommodation. There were initially five beds in the facility, which expanded to a ten-bed service in 2012. We would consider our model a hybrid of model (a) and (c) and our results indicate that such a model is effective in facilitating patient recovery. Given the heterogeneity of crisis house models, our outcomes cannot be generalised to other models of crisis house.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations, one being the limited sample size. Indeed, patients have a right to refuse to complete the DIALOG questionnaire, which explains the relatively little DIALOG data compared with HoNOS (85 <italic>v.</italic> 91). Although we attempted to administer the HoNOS scale to all patients, this could be done more predictably at admission: unscheduled discharges or very short admissions limited the opportunity to obtain discharge, and consequently, two-point data.</p><p>Unfortunately, the data used to analyse CROM and PROM outcomes did not include demographic details or ICD-10 codes. This information would have clarified the groups of individuals who most benefitted from the crisis house intervention. A previous multicentre study comparing the crisis house model to an in-patient psychiatric service noted that patient populations using both services were different with regards to gender, ethnicity and ICD 10.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This dissimilarity could mean crisis houses are not a &#x02018;true&#x02019; alternative to hospital admission, as the crisis house service could be treating patients who are not as unwell. This is an issue that does not affect the THCH: in a separate analysis performed by our group in 2015, we reviewed the patient profiles of crisis house clients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;299) and compared these with admissions to an acute in-patient ward (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;677), and found that patients matched on gender, ethnicity and ICD-10 code (results were presented as a poster at the RCPsych International Congress<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>).</p><p>For (the majority of) patients who demonstrated an improvement in HoNOS and DIALOG scores, we are unable to comment on the precise intervention, or indeed the interplay of interventions, that facilitated improvement in their mental health. Was it being in a safe environment, the therapeutic relationship, pharmacotherapy, practical support or natural resolution of their social crises? In the absence of specific documentation of diagnoses, interventions offered and a &#x02018;control&#x02019; group (e.g. an in-patient population), we are unable to discern the elements of the crisis house admission that were effective. It is also possible that this study has overestimated the impact of a crisis house intervention in the HoNOS and DIALOG scores, given patients for whom two-point data is available are more likely to have had a favourable course of treatment, as they would have been more engaged with staff and not made an unscheduled departure or required acute hospital admission.</p><p>In conclusion, we report evidence that a crisis house and HTT partnership can result in favourable results particularly around patients' mental health and safety as assessed by both the patient and clinician. Our findings support the effectiveness of a novel partnership model, supporting its continuance, and providing data to help mental health commissioners elsewhere in determining their local model of crisis care. Despite the study's limitations, its findings are worth disseminating, given that the evidence base for HTTs is inadequate and is even less established for crisis houses. Furthermore, the routine use of clinical outcome measurements in adult mental health remains patchy, despite significant national drivers. Our findings make a sizeable contribution to the limited literature describing the crisis house service, which is often poorly understood and infrequently commissioned. We hope this study encourages similar services to routinely collect and analyse PROM and CROM scores to develop a rich evidence base in this field.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Mohsin Faysal Butt</bold> is a medical student at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, UK. <bold>David Walls</bold> is manager of Tower Hamlets Crisis House service, Lookahead Housing, UK. <bold>Rahul Bhattacharya</bold> is a consultant psychiatrist with the Tower Hamlets Home Treatment Team and clinical lead for Crisis House, East London NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Obuaya</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stanton</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Baggaley</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name>
