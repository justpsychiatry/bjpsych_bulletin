Dr Giuseppe Spoto asks why the College has not made a statement about
the treatment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran and remembers that in
the past it has spoken out against abuse of psychiatry in the former
Soviet Union in the 1970s.

We remain active in responding to cases where we believe there has been
abuse of human rights. We have to be very cautious about making public
statements on these issues; we never act until we have taken advice from
those working closely with the family and supporters of the individual
concerned and from agencies such as Amnesty International. It would be
easy to unwittingly make the situation worse for the people involved.
