Within studies, only five delivered ECT with the same electrode placement and pulse width to all patients. This heterogeneity makes it very difficult to determine if any relationship exists between mode of delivery or demographic factors and risk of side-effects.

The SSMQ was the most widely used assessment tool, but doubt remains about how well subjective tools capture actual experience. A study reporting treatment satisfaction rates did not find the SSMQ to be an independent predictor variable in their multiple regression model.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>A further criticism of rating scales is that they produce a single summary or average score that may mask domain-specific complaints within the questionnaire. Studies using qualitative assessments of memory impairment have found subjective deficits at 24 weeks that were not picked up by scales designed to capture subjective experience.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p><p>A key limitation of all studies on ECT is the acceptability of the treatment versus the alternatives, which could include additional or alternative drug therapy or a longer period of illness. Also, with ECT usually being reserved for the most unwell patients, there are issues of impaired insight and recall bias that may undermine the construct validity of any subjective memory questionnaire in this patient population.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The few studies that assessed subjective memory several months beyond the end of ECT suggest that, on average, subjective memory scores tend to recover over time, with ultra-brief pulse showing fewer side-effects than brief pulse therapy. However, there is considerable heterogeneity both between and within studies, limiting meaningful conclusions. Past and future studies are vulnerable to high drop-out rates, observer bias and concerns over the face validity of standardised instruments designed to measure subjective memory. However, these tools and studies should not be dismissed as being unreflective of patient experience. Contemporaneous quantitative data provides a longitudinal picture, reduces hindsight bias and may be most useful in identifying common risk factors for significant memory loss rather than as a tool for identifying specific deficits. Future subjective memory studies should use the same outcome measure, such as the SSMQ, and measuring subjective memory should become a routine part of ECT treatment and follow-up, ideally allowing an international registry to be created to help us identify those at low and high risk of memory impairment. Comparable outcome measures should ideally be collected for patients receiving alternative treatments.</p><p>More qualitative studies are needed to identify common experiences, effects and meaning of any subjective memory loss after treatment, and ultimately, whether this is an acceptable risk from this treatment for major depression. Both of quantitative and qualitative approaches may then be used to develop more sensitive memory assessment tools, providing more informative to both patient and clinician during joint discussions around whether to proceed with a treatment that remains one of the most effective and controversial in medicine.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="other" id="nts1"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Dr Simon Vann Jones</bold> is an ST5 in old age psychiatry at Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust, Bodmin, UK. <bold>Dr Rick McCollum</bold> is a consultant in old age psychiatry at Devon Partnership Trust, Exeter, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>WK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ungvari</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>GW.</given-names></name>
