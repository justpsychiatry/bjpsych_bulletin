The hospital has approximately 200 male in-patients who are detained under various sections of the Mental Health Act 1983; none have unsupervised community leave. The hospital became a non-smoking unit on 1 July 2008. Tobacco products are not permitted in the hospital. This is a policy that is effectively implemented as all hospital staff, patients and visitors are subject to rigorous security measures, including searches in and out of the hospital and x-ray scanning of personal possessions. Patients no longer requiring treatment in a high secure unit are transferred either to prison or to medium secure units.

We identified patients prescribed clozapine who were discharged to medium secure units (both NHS and independent) from Ashworth Hospital from July 2008 to December 2013. Patients transferred to a medium secure unit on trial leave remain under the nominal care of the Responsible Clinician at Ashworth hospital and are routinely reviewed by clinical staff from Ashworth Hospital; trial leave is for a minimum period of 6 months and can be longer, allowing an opportunity to review case records and changes in smoking status. From the clinical notes we collected data on clozapine dose, plasma clozapine and norclozapine concentrations, smoking status and mental state in the 6 months pre-transfer and up to 12 months post-transfer. Patients who were either discharged without a period of trial leave, or remitted directly to court or prison were excluded. Plasma clozapine and norclozapine concentrations were monitored as necessary to help guide clozapine dose adjustment. The last clozapine plasma measurement on file was used as a measure of post-transfer plasma clozapine and norclozapine. Information routinely recorded when requesting plasma clozapine assays include the time and date of sample, time and date of last clozapine dose, clozapine dose (milligrams per day), mode of administration (tablets or suspension), duration of clozapine treatment, age (years), gender, body weight (kilograms), smoking status (yes/no) and other relevant information that could aid interpretation of the result, such as co-prescribed drugs and the reason for the assay request.</p><p>Statistical significance of analysed data was calculated using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests and Fisher's exact test as appropriate.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The service evaluation was registered within Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust.

Studies have shown that enforced tobacco abstinence in secure environments has little effect on post-release smoking status.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>There is an established association between tobacco smoking and the pharmacokinetics of clozapine, with higher clozapine doses generally required in smokers when compared with non-smokers. A previous evaluation of plasma clozapine concentrations before and after implementation of a hospital-wide smoking ban found a mean increase in plasma clozapine of 36% in non-smokers when outliers were excluded.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> We found a mean clozapine dose increase of 23% (median increase, 27%) occurred in smokers prescribed clozapine and this is less than the 40% dose increase recommended where one or more packs of cigarettes are used per day<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and less than the recommendation to increase the clozapine dose by a factor of 1.5 over a period of 2&#x02013;4 weeks.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This difference may be because of the effect of restricted time periods off the ward for patients in our sample, who were in a medium secure unit, which is likely to have limited their consumption of tobacco. However, it may also be that clinical teams were cautious in increasing clozapine doses, or patients were reluctant to take more clozapine, given the observed changes in mental state in the smoking group.</p><p>We found that receiving clinical teams were aware of the association between plasma clozapine and smoking status and the need to proactively monitor and adjust doses accordingly. As noted earlier, 72% of patients had plasma clozapine and norclozapine measured within 1 month of starting trial leave and this increased to 87% of patients at 3 months post-transfer. There were nevertheless adverse changes in the mental state of almost half of patients who had recommenced smoking. It is possible these symptoms were secondary to the observed reduction in plasma clozapine concentrations. Previous studies investigating the effects of smoking on mental state have focused on patients with neurosis rather than psychosis.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> We found that most patients experiencing changes in mental state had psychotic symptoms, although this may reflect the symptoms of this particular population from a high secure psychiatric unit. However, structured rating scales were not used in our survey given the nature of this evaluation.</p><p>Our study population was of a modest size and data were collected over a minimum follow-up period of 6 months, allowing ample time for changes to clozapine dosing schedules and changes in mental status to have been observed. A limitation of this study is our use of case notes as a source of patient data as case notes do not always include all data that would otherwise have been collected systematically via a structured interview. Our recording of patient mental status before and after smoking resumption is therefore open to assessment bias. Additionally, the post-transfer plasma clozapine and norclozapine concentrations used in this study were not necessarily performed before the recorded dose adjustments. Given the nature of this study (i.e. a service evaluation), we did not control for clozapine dose when measuring the effect of smoking on clozapine and norclozapine plasma concentrations. It should be noted that the non-smokers had a statistically significant lower norclozapine plasma concentration after transfer; we are unable to explain this finding. Finally, we cannot be certain that the non-smoking patients were entirely abstinent as we relied on patient notes to classify smoking status; we did not measure plasma or urine cotinine to confirm smoking status.</p><p>This evaluation is a reminder to clinicians that changes in smoking status may cause marked changes in clozapine plasma concentration, and require substantial adjustments in clozapine dosing. We anticipate this evaluation will assist clinicians in the management of patients prescribed clozapine who commence smoking after a period of abstinence and advocate close monitoring of plasma clozapine concentrations, clozapine dose and mental status in patients who change their smoking status, to minimise the risk of relapse.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Inti Qurashi</bold> is a consultant forensic psychiatrist in High Secure Services at Ashworth High Secure Hospital, Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Paul Stephenson</bold> is a consultant forensic psychiatrist in High Secure Services at Ashworth High Secure Hospital, Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Chitra Nagaraj</bold> is a consultant forensic psychiatrist in Low Secure Services at Hollins Park Hospital, North West Boroughs NHS Foundation Trust, UK. <bold>Simon Chu</bold> is a senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the School of Psychology, University of Central Lancashire, UK. <bold>Richard Drake</bold> is a senior lecturer and honorary consultant at the Division of Psychology and Mental Health, University of Manchester, UK. <bold>Lewis Couchman</bold> is Facility Director of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring at Analytical Services International, UK. <bold>Robert Flanagan</bold> is a consultant clinical scientist and Director of the Toxicology Unit at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Paton</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kerwin</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name>
