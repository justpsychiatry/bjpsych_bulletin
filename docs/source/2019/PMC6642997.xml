Prior to the development of the telepsychiatry service, consultations were provided in a standard face-to-face model. Studies included in this paper used both asynchronous and synchronous connections, with the latter being more common (three studies). Synchronous services provide live, two-way interactive transmission at geographically separate locations,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> thereby simulating face-to-face interviewing. Asynchronous services, by contrast, do not require the presence of both parties at the same time, and have the advantages of being relatively inexpensive and not requiring any special hardware support. The information can be transferred in the form of data, audio, video clips or recordings, and can be done by email or web applications for review by a specialist at a later date.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-6"><title>Length of follow-up</title><p>Follow-up length varied from 1 to 6 years.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-7"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measures varied considerably across the research studies and included cost savings to both patients and healthcare providers, patient and carer satisfaction, new diagnoses and medication changes.</p><p>Notably, there was a 96% decrease in emergency room visits (Gentile<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>) in the 12 months following treatment via the telepsychiatry model compared with the preceding 12 months. The authors of that study suggest that teams have access to nursing and medical staff between appointments to assist in problem-solving in real time when issues occur between appointments. They also discuss how staff provide education on de-escalation techniques and options when patients exhibit behavioural change. Although a remarkable 96% decrease was noted, one would question the practice that existed prior to the telepsychiatry model. It is likely that, as there was limited access to local professionals before, the patients and carers may have been able to access professionals remotely. Further information on this would have been useful to balance the use of high-cost medical services with multiple accesses to lower-cost services.</p><p>Gentile described hospital admissions decreasing by 85%. The authors also noted that of their first 120 subjects, none had been admitted or readmitted to state-operated institutions. They estimated the state of Ohio saving approximately US$80 000 per person per year in support costs. As above, more information on the frequency of contacts would have been useful. Although the study highlights several patients historically having had to use state-operated institutions, it cannot necessarily be concluded that the telepsychiatry intervention was the only reason there were no admissions or readmissions.</p><p>Harper<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> noted a positive attitude to their telemedicine group, with 98% stating that the experience was the same or more positive. Some parents (12%) reported technical problems such as poor audio and camera movement. Professionals rated the consultations as comparable to face-to-face consultations. There were no significant differences in consultation time. Over the time period, the authors evaluated costs including time, travel and mileage. They concluded that the average saving to the local district (professional and patterns) was US$971 per telemedicine session. Additionally, the average saving for parents was estimated to be US$125 per session, and fewer parents missed work.</p><p>Although there was no breakdown of cases in the Langkamp<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> study, the case studies included one illustrating a 10-year-old girl with intellectual disability and agitation. The authors comment that her parents were absent from work for healthcare visits less often as a result of using the telemedical link. The parents also reported appreciating their child receiving quality medical care without becoming excessively distressed.</p><p>Szeftel<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and colleagues reported their patients as being seen six times on average in the first year, and three times per year in the second and third years. Severity and number of symptoms were noted to have decreased over the three years, with fewer visits as treatment progressed and fewer medication changes. The authors noted that changes in medication, either in dosage or type, tended to take place in the first rather than in later appointments, with 82% of patients having a recommended medication change at the initial assessment; this may suggest an emphasis on a biological rather than a holistic approach.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec5"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first review to undertake a comprehensive synthesis of telepsychiatry in intellectual disability. There were two major findings: (a) very few reports of such studies exist; (b) all studies took place in North America. Unfortunately, it is therefore difficult to draw firm conclusions about the benefits and constraints of such a modality in this population group. The majority of the studies had relatively low sample sizes and focused on a single nation's health infrastructure (USA); hence, extrapolation to other populations and to other countries is potentially erroneous.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, most studies focused on children, given the relative ease of implementing such systems in children's services (as children attend schools and are more likely to have parents as guardians). It is therefore difficult to extrapolate satisfaction levels of parents to those of adult patients receiving such services. Information on exact numbers of patients with intellectual disability and mental illness or challenging behaviour was missing in half the studies. None of the studies discussed any legal implications of using remote services and storage of video data, nor how to escalate difficulties if and when they arose.</p><p>The absence of randomised controlled trials, the gold standard in research study design, was a major flaw in these studies &#x02013; and, in fact, in telepsychiatry research as a whole.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Furthermore, it is possible that there are commercial intellectual disability telepsychiatry services who have not published their data for economically sensitive reasons and have therefore been missed by the searches.</p><p>However, despite these limitations, it would be irresponsible to dismiss this body of evidence when taken in the context of the telepsychiatry and general telemedical literature. Most notably, several reviews of telepsychiatry in autism<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> have been conducted; these offer some overlapping features that could benefit those considering setting up telepsychiatry services in intellectual disability in other countries. There are potential legal and technological issues that could restrict the development of this field, and contextualising other non-intellectual disability studies could benefit such service innovators. Greenhalgh<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and colleagues recently conducted a mixed-method study on video out-patient consultations, in which it was concluded that despite such consultations appearing convenient, safe and effective, this was only in patients judged clinically appropriate and was a fraction of the overall clinic workload. The paper also highlights that the National Health Service appears to be a difficult setting in which to introduce technologies that imply major changes in service models.</p><p>The studies overall suggested positive effects of the telepsychiatry model for intellectual disability patients. Notably, an often-considered concern from professionals regarding remote consultations is the loss of subtleties and direct relationships that are built with face-to-face appointments. These studies and the literature as a whole<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> do not support this. In fact, there is even evidence that children with severe anxiety and autism can be more engaged during a telepsychiatry consultation.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p><p>In addition, there are notable savings to services, both directly and in prevention of future hospital admissions, which are likely to appeal to service providers. When this is taken in the context of the positive patient and carer satisfaction results noted in the studies, it is surprising there has not been a larger uptake of telepsychiatry services in intellectual disability. If they develop sufficiently, such services may become eventually be classified as a reasonable adjustment as per the UK Disability Discrimination Act. In fact, the most recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> for care and support of people growing older with learning disabilities includes specific advice to &#x02018;consider the use of technologies such as telehealth and telecare to complement but not replace the support provided by people face to face&#x02019;.</p><p>All studies identified were conducted in North America; no published UK or European studies were found. This is surprising, as the UK has a faculty of intellectual disability at the Royal College of Psychiatry (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/workinpsychiatry/faculties/intellectualdisability1.aspx.">https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/workinpsychiatry/faculties/intellectualdisability1.aspx</uri>) and a well-established training scheme for psychiatrists to specialise in intellectual disability psychiatry,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> as well as highly active patient advocate groups such as Mencap<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> However, psychiatric services are generally be closer to patient populations when compared with the USA. Of the locations mentioned in the studies identified, Iowa is significantly low in population density (21/km<sup>2</sup>) when compared with California and Ohio (93 and 109/km<sup>2</sup>, respectively),<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> although it is recorded as having more urban than rural population. In the UK, the population is more dense (271/km<sup>2</sup>)<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> overall, with an estimate of 83% of the population living in an urban setting.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> However, it is notable in the UK that many on-call rotas are non-residential, covering large geographical regions; thus, the application of telepsychiatry could benefit both patients and a significant proportion of psychiatrists who work with intellectual disability patients.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the identified studies focusing on intellectual disability services for children, the transition period from child and adolescent mental health services to adult services could be a positive avenue of research. Collaborative multi-professional appointments may in fact ease the transition, and research involving telepsychiatry could help to determine whether this is the case.<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> This is often a difficult period for patients, carers and professionals, particularly for those with intellectual disability.</p><p>More research in this field would be welcomed for less-developed and more geographically spaced-out healthcare systems. Implementing both synchronous and asynchronous remote consultations using some of the more accessible, encrypted and mainstream video streaming services with intellectual disability population groups is likely to become more feasible, given that broadband services (and reductions in costs) have permeated much of the globe, including geographically isolated areas. Further research in less-developed countries as well as in other healthcare systems would help to build a more robust literature and facilitate innovation in this field. The rolling out of broadband services across other nations, including the UK, has been relatively slow in comparison with the USA; this may partly explain the lack of telepsychiatry services, which require reasonable connection speeds.</p><p>Additionally, as costs of technology such as secure smartphone devices and cheap encrypted applications decrease and data connection speeds increase, it is likely that more healthcare providers internationally may consider both implementing telepsychiatry services and sharing their outcome data in the peer-reviewed literature. Integrating the findings would therefore enable best practice guidelines to be developed, for example.</p><p>None of the studies in this review mentioned the use of interpreters; their incorporation into telepsychiatry, whether for Makaton, other forms of signing or in fact more mainstream language translation, is another potential avenue of research.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref></p><p>It is feasible that access to expertise via international collaborations using asynchronous methods or taking advantage of time zone differences for synchronous methods could enable, for example, vulnerable intellectual disability populations in underserved areas to access specialist intellectual disability psychiatric care to aid in reducing mental distress. Additional health economic and environmental evaluations in differing healthcare systems could also clarify whether similar models of care are transposable to such systems. Specific evaluation of environmental benefits or effects would also be a useful outcome to evaluate in further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study identified four telemedical psychiatric consultation studies in intellectual disability, mainly limited to children. While there is some evidence of cost-effectiveness, improvement in patient and carer satisfaction, and convenience, the fact that there were relatively few studies limited to North America would suggest there is a need to explore further these novel methods of enhancing current psychiatric services.</p><p>Telepsychiatry models appear to aid in the empowerment of this patient group, as well as providing cost savings. However, further studies are required in other countries and across a wider age range before concluding that telepsychiatry in intellectual disability is an effective, acceptable and satisfying approach for providing psychiatric services for this underserved population group.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the author</title><p><bold>Giri Madhavan</bold> is a Specialist Trainee (ST6) in Psychiatry of Intellectual Disability at Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust, Coventry, UK.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Whittle</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Reppermund</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lenroot</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Trollor</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name>
