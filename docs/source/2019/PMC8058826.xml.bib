:Abstract:
   The Care Programme Approach (CPA) has been instrumental in embedding
   principles of holistic collaborative assessment and management into
   mental health care. Initially, its implementation was assisted by
   targeting those at greatest need. However dichotomising patients into
   more and less severe is now considered unhelpful and has been
   demonstrated to be unreliable. Division of patients into severe and
   not severe categories is no more logical than such a division of
   patients with physical health problems. CPA principles are now
   applied to all patients in mental health services and practice needs
   to move to individualised care, focusing on meeting quality standards
   and achieving positive outcomes. A system based on evidence-based
   clinical pathways and reliable measures of severity and need should
   replace the current approach.

The Care Programme Approach (CPA) was established in 1991 in England to
ensure that a safety net of care was provided for people with severe
mental illness.(n.d.a) It set out requirements for health and social
care assessment, including risk assessment, involving patients, carers,
the multidisciplinary team and other agencies. It was a response to the
Spokes inquiry into the death of Isobel Schwarz, a social worker whose
death, it concluded, resulted from a lack of effective coordination of
the care of a person who was severely mentally ill.(n.d.b) Patients
accepted by mental health services were required to have a key worker, a
care plan and a review date. The policy described two levels, basic and
enhanced. In practice, this generally meant that patients on a basic CPA
were seen by a single practitioner, often a doctor in the case of
out-patients, while those on an advanced plan saw a doctor, a
non-medical mental health professional (later designated as a care
coordinator) and, where involved, other agencies.

In 2008, the CPA was refocused on the enhanced level, although the
previous requirements remained for all those under mental health
services.(n.d.c) The impetus for this ‘refocusing’ came from the
recognition that allocation to CPA was inconsistent, and that there was
a need to improve care coordination and reduce bureaucracy. A set of
criteria were introduced to determine eligibility for ‘new CPA’, and
principles for working with patients on CPA were described in detail.

CPA was therefore revised to describe a group of patients with more
severe mental illness. Targets have been set by the government (Monitor
and now NHS Improvement) for all CPA patients to have a care plan
reviewed every year and, under the National Commissioning for Quality
and Innovation payments framework, to receive at least an annual
physical health check. The number of people on CPA is also sometimes
used as a proxy for the severity of illness of individuals in services
and on caseloads, and for use in service redesign.

Services have now progressed such that the broad principles of CPA are
fully accepted by professionals and regulatory bodies (`Fig.
1 <#fig01>`__). However, there is no evidence as yet that CPA criteria
are applied consistently across services, or that this has improved over
the years:(n.d.d) current figures range from 1.7% to 23.5% of patients
allocated to CPA,(n.d.e) which is not proportional to morbidity.
Similarly, there is no sign that the quality as opposed to quantity of
care plans or health checks and interventions is adequate. The CPA
definition is broad and subjective, and applying a ‘tick box’ approach
to care plans and physical health checks is at best only a first step
towards improving their application. Dichotomising patients into CPA or
not is overly simplistic and allocation of resources has not explicitly
followed, although managers probably give consideration to providing
increased resources and time for increased need (whether on CPA or not).
It has also contributed, despite the emphasis on its being primarily a
clinical process, to an administrative rather than a person focus: ‘Care
plans were described as administratively burdensome and were rarely
consulted. Carers reported varying levels of involvement. Risk
assessments were central to clinical concerns but were rarely discussed
with service users. Service users valued therapeutic relationships with
care coordinators and others, and saw these as central to
recovery’.(n.d.f) Fig. 1Care programme approach.

When it was introduced, CPA was intended to lead to a prioritisation of
service delivery to people according to their needs. The allocation to
enhanced CPA can be argued to have initially achieved this, and
refocusing on CPA provided further reinforcement. Such prioritisation
remains necessary, but allocation to CPA is a blunt instrument. In
practice, applying targets to CPA and the bureaucracy that has often
developed have also been disincentives to allocating patients to it.

An option to remedy this might be to seek to improve reliability of
allocation to CPA by using outcome measures which profile severity, such
as the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). Symptom and/or
social measures on HoNOS or Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation
(CORE)(n.d.g) and risk ratings could be used in combination, for
example, all patients rated as having severe mental illness (i.e. high
symptom scores, or moderate with significant disability) and a medium or
high risk rating according to national guidance(n.d.h) for more than a
month could be included. The criteria also might include consideration
of a range of other issues, for example, multi-agency involvement and
carer stress, but these would be more difficult to quantify reliably.

CPA and clinical pathways
=========================

The principles of CPA have therefore been accepted as an essential
foundation on which improvement of the quality of community services has
been based, and broad consensus has been reached that it should be
applied. However, CPA may no longer be assisting in moving services
towards systematic application of the evidence-based clinical guidelines
and quality standards which have been developed since it was instigated.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has
described these for a range of clinical conditions, and they have been
operationalised into care pathways describing ‘what should happen
when’.(n.d.i) This requires individuals to be allocated to care pathways
in accordance with their needs, which go beyond ‘severe’ and ‘less
severe’ categories. These quality standards and outcome measures are
relevant to pathways and need to be systematically implemented and
monitored. Clinical measures such as the HoNOS and patient-rated
measures such as DIALOG(n.d.j) support this and are relatively simple
and quick to use. DIALOG asks how satisfied the person is about key
issues in their lives: not just mental and physical health, but
accommodation, leisure, safety and relationships. It profiles need and
clinical state, provides a patient-rated experience measure and links
directly to care plans by eliciting the specific issues with which the
individual wants help (`Fig. 2 <#fig02>`__). Fig. 2Pathways, outcomes
and standards.

Such outcome measurements can allow the development of definitions of
recovery, meaningful improvement, stability and deterioration. These may
be more complex than those used for Improving Access to Psychological
Services, but, in practice, it is feasible to set service definitions
using these measures and other available information, e.g. relapse or
disengagement from services. Recovery or improvement can be reflected by
using a balance of increased satisfaction levels, symptoms, functioning
and lower needs. Quality and outcomes can be improved and payment
systems developed to replace block contracts, which have been blunt and
ineffective instruments to fund services and are very vulnerable to
arbitrary cuts. Subdivision into costing groups will become possible as
data develops with greater clinical validity and reliability than the
current ‘clustering’ system.(n.d.k) These costing groups can use some of
the principles and practice used in ‘clustering’, but by using condition
pathways and severity scores linked to clinical guidelines and quality
standards.

A starting point, therefore, is allocation to pathways, e.g. psychosis,
affective, emotionally unstable personality and organic mental
disorders, using broad NICE clinical guidelines which can be expanded to
the further pathways, e.g. within affective disorders, bipolar,
depressive and individual anxiety disorders, as these are embedded in
services and reach across the lifespan. Although patients may have
multiple conditions, primary pathways can usually be allocated in
practice. HoNOS and other measures can then be used to determine symptom
severity to provide groupings and weightings for physical health issues,
and social needs can be incorporated. Use of pathways and severity can
lead to more meaningful prioritisation than attempting to allocate to
CPA or non-CPA across all patients with mental illness. Prioritising
within each pathway in terms of need and risk is more meaningful for
measuring whether standards are being met and directing evidence-based
care.

Our experience with replacing clustering with allocation of pathways,
DIALOG, HoNOS and standards assessment with an algorithm for
severity/pathway ‘clusters’ has been positive, with ready acceptance by
mental health staff (over 5000 allocations made within the first 3
months). This algorithm is now providing clinically relevant data to
redesign, support and manage services, and is being developed with local
clinical commissioning groups for costing purposes.

Do we need CPA?
===============

So do we need to retain CPA? ‘Allocation to CPA’ is currently a means of
defining a level of severity, but allocation to clinical pathways and
use of outcome data to profile groups is a much richer and more reliable
approach to identifying and quantifying need. Clinical practice is not
dependent on whether someone is on CPA or not, but is an individualised
process. CPA has been invaluable in setting principles and practice to
follow as services in the community have developed, but mental health
services now need to move beyond it. CPA might possibly have a role in
differentiating those with greater risk and need from those with less
risk, but is this really helpful in clinical practice, service design
and benchmarking?

Why should NHS Improvement, as currently, expect 12-month reviews of
care plans only for people on CPA? Isn't this relevant to all people in
mental health services, although the complexity and length of a care
plan will vary according to the needs addressed? Is the physical
healthcare of people on CPA, another target, more important than that of
those who are not? There is certainly an issue of prioritising resources
to ensure the most effective care, but isn't a person who is not on CPA
with diabetes at least as in need of linking with primary care as one
who is on CPA but lacks a physical health problem? CPA has done an
invaluable job, but time has passed and more individualised and
sophisticated pathway-based systems should now be adopted.

University of Southampton, and Clinical Director (Adult Mental Health)
and honorary consultant psychiatrist to Southern Health NHS Foundation
Trust. Rehabilitation services in Hackney, London, led by John Reed
(then senior psychiatrist in the Department of Health), and in
Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire where David Kingdon was clinical director,
were the inspiration for the CPA policy after the professional bodies at
that time had been unable to agree a way forward. After moving to work
in the Department in 1991, dissemination of CPA was a key part of the
role as a senior medical officer. David Kingdon's interest in the CPA
process and development has continued since appointment as a professor
of mental health service delivery and through involvement in many
policy, research and management initiatives, and in developing and
implementing evidence-based practice for severe mental illness.
