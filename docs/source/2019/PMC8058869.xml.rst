In the past, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has been very active
challenging abuse in relation to psychiatry; I distinctly remember, for
example, Dr S. Bloch and others successfully exposing abuse of
psychiatry in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s.

Why is the College silent about the antediluvian treatment recently
endured by Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran? Simply by exposing such
barbaric practice on the international stage and using its authority,
the College may succeed where others have failed, namely in ensuring her
immediate release.
