The reasons for this may be that relatively few trainees spend time in out of programme experiences (OOPEs) outside of their programme in psychiatry. However, it may be that, similar to the GP vocational training scheme (VTS) programme, many trainees take time but do not apply for their OOPE to count towards their CCT. Reasons may be that the training programme is relatively short (6&#x02013;7 years depending on endorsements). It is noted that there are relatively low competition ratios in psychiatry at CT1 and specialty trainee year 4 (ST4) entry over the period analysed. It may be that many trainees do not feel the need to develop their curriculum vitaes in this way through research and OOPT. Qualitative analysis could explore the reasons why in future studies.</p><p id="P41">A further possible explanation is that trainees do not have an awareness of the process and role of Royal College of Psychiatrists in signposting and supporting applications for OOPT or OOPR. It may be that on a practical level out of programme opportunities and processes within the college and deaneries need to be more actively promoted.</p><p id="P42">The analysis shows that about two-thirds of trainees (64%) who apply for OOPT or OOPR are successful in getting approval by the Quality Assurance Committee. The Committee noted that a proportion of approvals were incomplete and required further information or evidence of mapping to the curriculum or training programme. We have simplified the application system by creating a form that prompts trainees to complete all of the required information. This went live in October 2012 on the College website. The updated guidance document is available on the College website.</p><p id="P43">There are relatively low numbers of OOPR applications (54 over 64 months). This suggests that there is a relatively low interest in research opportunities outside of the academic clinical fellow scheme; just 1.5% (54/3606) trainees have had the opportunity to be actively involved in a full-time research opportunity as OOPR. This suggests that relatively few trainees will have exposure to practical research experience, which may be of some concern to academics and the profession. Medicine and allied health sciences is based on the principles of evidence-based practice, where current best evidence is utilised in making decisions about the care of individual patients, therefore research is critical to developing psychiatry&#x02019;s evidence base and practice.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p id="P44">It is noted there are relatively high numbers of applications from the London deanery (53%), compared with all of the other deaneries. The data demonstrate that London, compared with the UK as a whole, has the same rate of uptake of OOPT and OOPR, when taking into account the total number of psychiatry trainees in the deaneries. Despite a large number of applications from London, applications were not significantly more or less likely to be approved. This supports the transparency of the application and review process. This was also found for ethnicity supporting issues around equal opportunities and diversity. The larger number (not rate) of OOPTs and OOPRs in London suggests that there may be a culture there that encourages trainees to develop their expertise through OOPTs or OOPRs, which is not the case in other regions to the same extent. However, it may be because a large proportion of the research and training opportunities available out of programme are in London as a result of the high number of expert centres and universities. It may be that there is a supportive &#x02018;hidden curriculum&#x02019; in London; led by supervisors with explicit links to these centres in signposting, promoting and supporting trainees in research and additional training.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Implications</title><p id="P45">Overall, although only a small proportion of trainees apply for OOPT or OOPR. Our analysis indicates that the process of its quality assurance is transparent in terms of applicants by ethnicity or deanery. The majority of applications overall are successful. Future research should examine how psychiatry compares with other specialisms in more detail and the reasons why low percentages of psychiatry trainees are applying for OOPT or OOPR. However, there is a lack of easily accessible comparative data making generalisations across specialisms difficult.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p id="P46">We wish to thank the Quality Assurance Committee for their input.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
