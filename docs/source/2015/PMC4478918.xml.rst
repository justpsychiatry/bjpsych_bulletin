:Abstract:
   **Aims and method** This paper intends to analyse the number of
   applications, trainee demographic and approval rate of those applying
   for out of programme training (OOPT) or out of programme research
   (OOPR) between January 2008 and April 2013 using the committee’s
   anonymised database. We also describe the process of application and
   approval by the Quality Assurance Committee.

   **Results** There were 90 applications, including 10 resubmissions
   during the 64-month period. Most applicants (77%) were higher
   trainees; 53% of applicants were from the London deanery; 60% of
   applications were for research posts and higher degrees (OOPR).
   Overall, 64% were approved by the committee: 70% for OOPRs and 53%
   for OOPTs.

   **Clinical implications** This paper shows with transparency the
   breakdown of applications to the Quality Assurance Committee. Around
   two-thirds of applications to the committee are supported (64%).
   Relatively few psychiatry trainees (2.5%) have applied for an OOPT or
   an OOPR over the past 5 years.

The Quality Assurance Committee at the Royal College of Psychiatrists
includes a group of consultants across all specialities, a lay member,
carer and trainee representative. The committee leads on the review and
college approval of trainee’s out of programme training (OOPT) or
research (OOPR). Trainees seeking for their OOPT or OOPR to count
towards part of their psychiatric training and therefore certificate in
clinical training (CCT) apply prospectively to the committee via a
structured application form. In this article we will review the process
of applying, the outcomes of those that apply, the common pitfalls and
problems for those that are unsuccessful and review the demographics of
applicants.

Method
======

We analysed the numbers of applications, trainee deanery and ethnicity
and approval rate of those applying for OOPT or OOPR between January
2008 and April 2013 using the Quality Assurance committee’s anonymised
database. We also describe the process of application (see `Box
1 <#box1>`__) and approval by the Quality Assurance Committee.

The Applicants
--------------

There were 90 applications to the Quality Assurance Committee between
January 2008 and April 2013, a 64-month period. This included 10
resubmissions. The descriptive data on core and higher trainees;
approval rates; and applications by deanery is described in `Table
1 <#T1>`__.

.. _S4:

Approval v. non-approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of the 90 applications, 58 (64%) were approved and 32 (36%) not approved
on the first application. Of the 32 applications not approved, 10 (31%)
trainees resubmitted additional evidence or information with 8 (80%)
successful in gaining approval. Of the 10 resubmitted, 1 application
required minor changes and was approved after personal correspondence
between committee members between meetings. Nine (90%) were reviewed at
the subsequent committee meeting following resubmission.

.. _S5:

Core v. higher trainee applicants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overall most applications were from higher trainees; 77% (70/90). Core
trainees included those who were core trainees at the time of applying.
These trainees may be applying for OOPT or OOPR in their next post,
which may be a higher training post. This may have had an impact on the
actual proportion taking OOPT or OOPR in their higher training.

**Box 1** The application process

Trainee applies for a specific training or research opportunity not part
of their programme.Trainee starts deanery/LETB process for applying for
local approvals; leading to signed LETB form usually by educational
supervisor, training programme director and dean or head of
school.Trainee looks at website:
http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/qualityassurance.aspx for timeline of
next quality assurance committee meeting.If trainee does not want to
have OOPT/OOPR to count towards CCT, the trainee need not apply to the
Quality Assurance Committee at the College.If trainee wants some or all
of the OOPT/OOPR to count towards their CCT they then apply to the
Quality Assurance Committee using the structured application form on the
website in the area on quality assurance of training
(http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/qualityassurance.aspx) before
starting the new post (i.e. prospectively).The trainee includes a
covering letter, copy of the signed local approval, the Quality
Assurance Committee application form and all the recommended supporting
evidence.The Committee meet quarterly and review all of the
applications. The applications are not anonymised so any members who
know the trainee or have a conflict of interest leaves the room.The
Committee then recommend approval, request for further information or
non-approval by letter to the applicant. This includes the number of
weeks to months to count towards CCT. Those that are not approved are
given the reasons for the decision.The approved applications are then
forwarded to the General Medical Council for final approval and a letter
is sent to the applicant with their amended CCT date.Applications that
required minor further information are usually reviewed in between
meetings online. Applications that require resubmission or are less
minor are reviewed at the following quarterly meeting.A letter to the
applicant, advising the result, is sent by email and post within 1–2
weeks of the quarterly meeting.

Applications by deanery or local education training board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We analysed the 90 applications across deaneries, now local education
training boards (LETBs). The largest deanery in the UK is London in
terms of psychiatry trainee numbers. The London deanery applicants made
up 53% of applicants (48/90) with the other deaneries making up the
remaining. We found that OOPT and OOPR applications were at the same
rate in the London deanery (2.5%) as in the overall trainee sample
(2.5%); during 2008–2013 the London deanery had 1918 trainees. As a
result of the relatively small numbers applying from deaneries outside
London, data from all other deaneries was combined for statistical
analysis. These data were compared with data from the London deanery.
Results from chi-squared analysis (χ\ :sup:`2`\ (1,\ *n* = 89) = 0.94,
*P* = 0.33) indicates that there was no significant difference in the
likelihood of success on an application based on deanery location
(London *v.* outside London). This supports the transparency of the
application process by deanery.

.. _S7:

The diversity data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Quality Assurance Committee reviewed trainee’s ethnicity against
application approval for all declared ethnic groups. This was as part of
the committee’s process to ensure there was no discrimination as part of
the approval process. Declared ethnicity is available for all
applications since January 2009. The database includes 76 applications;
95% (*n* = 72) of trainees declared their ethnicity on the OOP
application. `Table 2 <#T2>`__ shows that across trainees that declare
their ethnicity, 33% (19/57) of White trainees did not have their
applications supported *v.* 40% (6/15) of Black and minority ethnic
trainees. Data was statistically analysed to see if self-declared ethnic
group (White or non-White) was significantly related to the likelihood
of success for OOPT and OOPR applications. Chi-squared analysis
(χ\ :sup:`2` (1, *n* = 72) = 0.23, *P* = 0.63) indicates that there was
no significant difference in the likelihood of success based on
ethnicity. This supports the transparency of the application process by
ethnicity.

.. _S8:

OOPT v. OOPR
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The majority of trainee applications 60% (54/90) were for OOPR. The
remaining were for OOPT 36% (32/90) and 4% (4/90) were unclear from
College databases. A total of 16 of the 54 (30%) OOPR applications were
not approved to count towards training or CCT (this included
resubmissions). Of the OOPR applications, the majority were for research
posts, PhDs and research fellowships. Some diverse applications were
approved including a 12-week research post in Ghana and an MSc that
counted towards CCT.

| Of the 32 OOPT applications to the College, 15 (47%) were unsuccessful
  in gaining college support towards a CCT. Of the successful 17
  applications, 4 (24%) were for forensic training including 3 forensic

  in London at the Maldives High Commission Drugs Policy Unit, clinical
  lecturer and clinical posts in the UK.

.. _S9:

Reasons for non-approval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the 16 OOPR applications not approved, 8 (50%) required further
necessary information. For example not including the requested
supporting information, not stating how psychotherapy competencies in
core training would be met as part of the post or not including previous
information on posts. For the remaining rejected applications, reasons
for non-approval of core trainees related to issues such as taking OOP
too early in core training (contrary to The Gold Guide\ :sup:`1`) (one);
taking additional OOPS in core training when already on an academic
clinical fellow (ACF) scheme with a 75% clinical post (one). Pitfalls
for higher trainees included requesting multiple OOPT or OOPRs to count
towards training (three), clinical lecturer posts whose timetables did
not meet the clinical training requirements (one), overseas posts that
did not meet the curriculum, or trainees who had already completed 24 or
more months training at the time of application (two).

For 15 OOPT applications not approved, 6 (40%) were posts in Australia.
The main reasons for unsuccessful applications included a lack of
evidence particularly around work-based assessments or documenting how
assessments would take place. Other reasons for non-approved
applications included the following.

Retrospective and did demonstrate coverage of the curriculum.One was for
an infant mental health post (children aged 0–3), which is not part of
the UK higher training child and adolescent mental health services
(CAMHS) curriculum.One was for a post at a House of Commons Committee
that did not map to the curriculum.One was for a post overseas where the
duties appeared too junior for equivalence of a higher trainee.One post
overseas did not demonstrate how the curriculum competencies would be
met.One had an incorrectly completed application form.One was a core
trainee before core trainee year 3 (CT3) who had not completed 2 years
of core training prior to an OOPT as recommended by the Gold Guide.The
remaining two required further information to support their application.

Trainee psychiatrists v. other colleges trainees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of the current psychiatry trainees 90 out of 3606 (2.5%) core and higher
trainees in psychiatry have applied for OOPT or OOPR. Following request
to the other Royal Colleges for comparative data, we have three returns
with some information. The responses were from the Royal College of
General Practitioners (RCGP), the Royal College of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology (RCOG) and The Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath).

The RCGP confirmed that they have no OOPT or OOPR approved to their
knowledge. They report that as general practice is a short training
programme of 3 years, which includes a mix of training opportunities
there is no need to do OOPT. Of those that take time out, for example to
work overseas, it is usually recorded as a career break (OOPC) and
therefore is dealt with at deanery/LETB level. In terms of OOPR, GP
trainees have the opportunity to apply for an academic clinical fellow
(ACF) scheme and therefore do not require OOPR during the training
period.

The RCOG report that, in 2012, 26 of their trainees had OOPR or OOPT and
62 in 2011. The RCPath report that since 2003, 20 trainees have applied
for OOPRs and 7 trainees applied for OOPT and 100% of trainees were
approved to count towards training and their CCT. Both colleges did not
supply the numbers of trainees in total to compare the rates of OOPT and
OOPR with psychiatry

.. _S11:

Discussion
==========

Out of programme training and research remains a fairly uncommon
experience with just 2.5% of psychiatry trainees applying for a training
or research experience outside of their programme to count towards their
CCT. The reasons for this may be that relatively few trainees spend time
in out of programme experiences (OOPEs) outside of their programme in
psychiatry. However, it may be that, similar to the GP vocational
training scheme (VTS) programme, many trainees take time but do not
apply for their OOPE to count towards their CCT. Reasons may be that the
training programme is relatively short (6–7 years depending on
endorsements). It is noted that there are relatively low competition
ratios in psychiatry at CT1 and specialty trainee year 4 (ST4) entry
over the period analysed. It may be that many trainees do not feel the
need to develop their curriculum vitaes in this way through research and
OOPT. Qualitative analysis could explore the reasons why in future
studies.

A further possible explanation is that trainees do not have an awareness
of the process and role of Royal College of Psychiatrists in signposting
and supporting applications for OOPT or OOPR. It may be that on a
practical level out of programme opportunities and processes within the
college and deaneries need to be more actively promoted.

The analysis shows that about two-thirds of trainees (64%) who apply for
OOPT or OOPR are successful in getting approval by the Quality Assurance
Committee. The Committee noted that a proportion of approvals were
incomplete and required further information or evidence of mapping to
the curriculum or training programme. We have simplified the application
system by creating a form that prompts trainees to complete all of the
required information. This went live in October 2012 on the College
website. The updated guidance document is available on the College

There are relatively low numbers of OOPR applications (54 over 64
months). This suggests that there is a relatively low interest in
research opportunities outside of the academic clinical fellow scheme;
just 1.5% (54/3606) trainees have had the opportunity to be actively
involved in a full-time research opportunity as OOPR. This suggests that
relatively few trainees will have exposure to practical research
experience, which may be of some concern to academics and the
profession. Medicine and allied health sciences is based on the
principles of evidence-based practice, where current best evidence is
utilised in making decisions about the care of individual patients,
therefore research is critical to developing psychiatry’s evidence base
and practice.\ :sup:`2`

It is noted there are relatively high numbers of applications from the
London deanery (53%), compared with all of the other deaneries. The data
demonstrate that London, compared with the UK as a whole, has the same
rate of uptake of OOPT and OOPR, when taking into account the total
number of psychiatry trainees in the deaneries. Despite a large number
of applications from London, applications were not significantly more or
less likely to be approved. This supports the transparency of the
application and review process. This was also found for ethnicity
supporting issues around equal opportunities and diversity. The larger
number (not rate) of OOPTs and OOPRs in London suggests that there may
be a culture there that encourages trainees to develop their expertise
through OOPTs or OOPRs, which is not the case in other regions to the
same extent. However, it may be because a large proportion of the
research and training opportunities available out of programme are in
London as a result of the high number of expert centres and
universities. It may be that there is a supportive ‘hidden curriculum’
in London; led by supervisors with explicit links to these centres in
signposting, promoting and supporting trainees in research and
additional training.

Implications
------------

Overall, although only a small proportion of trainees apply for OOPT or
OOPR. Our analysis indicates that the process of its quality assurance
is transparent in terms of applicants by ethnicity or deanery. The
majority of applications overall are successful. Future research should
examine how psychiatry compares with other specialisms in more detail
and the reasons why low percentages of psychiatry trainees are applying
for OOPT or OOPR. However, there is a lack of easily accessible
comparative data making generalisations across specialisms difficult.

We wish to thank the Quality Assurance Committee for their input.
