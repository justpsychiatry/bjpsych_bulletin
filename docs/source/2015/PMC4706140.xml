Established in 2010, the Southwark and Lambeth Memory Service (SLMS) provides memory assessment services in two inner London boroughs, to people over the age of 18 with mild to moderate memory problems and without an existing diagnosis of dementia. Patients are offered a comprehensive assessment, with initial cognitive testing using the Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III). Patients are also offered brain neuroimaging and, where indicated, additional neuropsychological testing. Diagnoses are considered within a multidisciplinary team and appropriate treatment and follow-up are agreed with patients and carers.</p><p id="P6">The National Dementia Strategy<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> prioritises early diagnosis and intervention in people with dementia. Current research, however, suggests that people from BME backgrounds present to memory assessment services later in the course of their disease.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This prevents them from benefiting from intervention and treatment as early as their White British counterparts.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This study examines the stage at which the BME population presents to SLMS and their rates of dementia diagnosis, and considers subsequent areas for service development to better meet the needs of different ethnic groups.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><p id="P7">The study received approval from the shared research and development office of the Institute of Psychiatry and Maudsley Hospital. The analysis used anonymised data from a referrals database, maintained for the purposes of service monitoring, and includes patients referred during the first 2 years of the SLMS's operation. Information on patients' ethnicity, age at the time of referral, scores on initial cognitive testing and the diagnosis given by the service was collated. Data are drawn from the SLMS's use of earlier versions of the cognitive tests cited above (the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>). In cases where patients' diagnostic classification changed during the course of their involvement with the service (e.g. from mild cognitive impairment to dementia), the initial diagnosis is used. To avoid bias, people unable to fully complete the two cognitive tests were excluded from the analysis.</p><p id="P8">We used the harmonised ethnic group categorisations from the 2001 UK census<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> to allow for comparisons between the SLMS sample and data on the ethnic composition of the local population. For the purpose of data analysis, patients were divided into two groups: White British (WB) and Black and minority ethnic (BME). Definitions of BME are wide-reaching and may include anyone with a &#x02018;cultural heritage which is differentiated from that of the White majority of the UK&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Owing to the very small number of patients from some ethnic groups in the SLMS sample, only patients from Caribbean and African backgrounds were included in the BME group. Comment is made in the discussion section on the relevance of the findings to people from other BME backgrounds.</p><p id="P9">Differences in the stage of presentation to the memory service were analysed by comparing patients' ages at the time of referral and MMSE and ACE-R scores on initial cognitive assessment. The prevalence of dementia diagnoses within each of the two groups was compared using Pearson's chi-squared test. Scores on cognitive testing for patients receiving a diagnosis of dementia were also compared. Unless otherwise stated, all means were compared using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, having first satisfied the criteria for Levene's test of equality of variances; <italic>P</italic>=0.05 were deemed to be significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">Overall, 460 patients referred between January 2011 and December 2012 completed the assessment process and received a diagnosis from the service.

A survey of clinical dementia centres across Europe found varying levels of access by BME patients and that where these patients did access services, diagnostic evaluation was more challenging owing to language barriers and the availability only of cognitive assessment tools validated in Western cultures.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Older Chinese and Vietnamese patients in Australia were believed to present to memory services at a more advanced stage of cognitive impairment<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and linguistic and cultural complexities may have contributed to longer waits for diagnosis in primary care.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> BME populations were diagnosed with dementia at an earlier age in one Danish study,<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and similar barriers to help-seeking for carers of BME patients with dementia were evident in research from both Australia<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and the USA.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Given the international recognition of the growing need for culturally sensitive memory services (including throughout Europe,<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> the USA<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and Australia<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>), the findings of this study are likely to be relevant to those working in such settings.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P24">This study is limited in its use of data collected in the course of routine clinical practice. Assessments were carried out by a variety of clinicians and although all were trained in the cognitive tools used, the question of interrater reliability remains. Standardised data on the educational background of participants are also unavailable. In addition, only patients who consented to and completed the assessment and diagnosis process were included in this study. There is no data on the ethnicity of the patients who refused assessment or who were unable to complete the process for other reasons, thus we cannot speculate on whether ethnicity may influence this. Some ethnic groups, such as South Asian people, were not represented in our analysis. The issues influencing presentation to memory services may be similar for these groups; for example, a study on Gujarati populations also found lower MMSE scores and a lower median age in the Gujarati group of a community screening programme.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The small numbers of patients from other BME populations indicates the need for further research into the extent to which they are accessing the SLMS, and limits the ability of this study to draw wider conclusions about the experiences of BME people.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Clinical implications</title><p id="P25">Compared with local population figures, the SLMS sample includes a higher proportional representation of African&#x02013;Caribbean-born people than might be expected. While this finding may seem positive, our results show a more marked degree of cognitive impairment in the BME group, despite the younger age at presentation. This indicates a need to work with local stakeholders to ensure a lower threshold for referring African&#x02013;Caribbean patients to the service, and to investigate ease of access for patients from other BME groups.</p><p id="P26">Culturally sensitive assessment is also required. This includes reflection on the way cognitive impairment is assessed in a population with varied cultural and educational backgrounds<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and an avoidance of stereotypical beliefs.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Culturally sensitive cognitive tools should be used where they exist, and cognitive testing should not be the only means of determining diagnoses.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The SLMS should continue the approach of considering cognitive test scores in the context of patient and carer accounts, brain neuroimaging, screening for affective disorders and additional neuropsychological testing to ensure accurate diagnosis. GPs also need to be aware of potential differences in age at onset of dementia and vascular risk differentials, to ensure effective cardiovascular preventative measures and arrange appropriate and early onward referral to secondary care.</p><p id="P27">Further analysis of similar data from a range of local memory services would be useful in detecting whether the trends evident in this study are reflected in the local population and other BME groups. It would be useful to include non-mental health services diagnosing dementia (e.g. geriatricians' clinics and neurology) in this analysis. The analysis into severity of impairment at presentation could be expanded by combining cognitive scores with other rating scales assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms and activities of daily living. Differences in other aspects of service provision and quality of life, such as assessment refusal rates, treatment with cognitive enhancer medications and the role of support networks in encouraging or discouraging help-seeking could also be explored.</p><p id="P28">Caution must be applied to the interpretation of these results. Although the term BME may imply homogeneity, it encompasses a wide variety of unique individual and collective experiences<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and the diversity both within and between ethnic groups must not be overlooked. Ethnicity may play an important role in influencing presentation to memory services, but this is only one part of the picture, and consideration for individual difference must always remain paramount.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>R.T. received salary support from the <funding-source>National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London</funding-source> and <funding-source>Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust</funding-source> and <funding-source>King's College London</funding-source>.
