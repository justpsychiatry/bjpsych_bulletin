We collected data through two routes, a health professional questionnaire and a review of patient case notes. The audit highlighted areas of good practice and areas which need further improvement.</p><p id="P23">The majority of our patients were young (72.1% were 18 to 44 years old), which is very similar to Asian patients having ECT<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> but different from trends in Western countries, where patients are usually elderly.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Chanpattana et al<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> suggested that this difference in age group trends could be caused by Asian population demographics and the fact that schizophrenia (with higher prevalence in younger patients) is the main indication for ECT in Asian patients. These explanations could also be valid for our Iraqi sample.</p><p id="P24">The gender distribution of our sample was roughly equal. This is slightly different from what is known in Asian countries, where more males receive ECT,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and from Western countries, where more females do.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A possible reason for this near-equal gender distribution is that, in Iraq, there was found to be no gender difference in depression;<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> however, it is also possible that our finding was accidental.</p><p id="P25">Another finding which was very similar to Chanpattana et al's<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> was that schizophrenia was the major indication for ECT (51% v. 41.8% in their sample). This finding is slightly different from what Iraqi psychiatrists report about the indications for ECT. In a recent survey which included 73 Iraqi psychiatrists, the first indication mentioned was depression, followed by schizophrenia.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The use of ECT in schizophrenia could raise a number of questions about the appropriateness and reasons for its use. International guidelines do not recommend ECT in general cases of schizophrenia, but as an option where clozapine has already proved ineffective or intolerable.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A review concluded that ETC might be an option in patients who show poor response to medication<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and this was also cited as the main reason for ECT in our sample. The lack or unavailability of clozapine and the difficulties associated with blood monitoring in Iraq might be one reason for poor treatment response. The practice of having a second opinion for the use of ECT in schizophrenia is still very rare in Iraq (5.5%) and needs to be encouraged.</p><p id="P26">It is encouraging that the majority (70.1%) of ECT in our study was modified ECT. This figure indicates a significant improvement in this area: although we do not have exact figures, we are aware that prior to 2003 ECT was mostly given in an unmodified way. This also seems better than the practice of ECT in Asian countries in general, where 55.7% of patients still receive unmodified ECT,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> but is below the 100% standard stipulated by the Iraqi ECT Policy and the practice in high-income countries.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Unmodified ECT was applied only in three hospitals and the unavailability of anaesthetists was the only reason. Measures to address this resource issue need to be taken by the Ministry of Health. Closure of ECT clinics where general anaesthesia is not available might be one, albeit the last resort, option. In this context, we are aware that the biggest psychiatry hospital in Iraq (which has 1200 beds) has stopped ECT treatment because of the unavailability of anaesthetists and patients who need ECT are transferred to an acute hospital where a modified ECT is given. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of ECTs (Tamimy J, 2011, personal communication).</p><p id="P27">In addition to human resources, this audit identified other shortcomings such as the number of rooms, the age of the ECT machine and the lack of EEG monitoring facilities. Improving these areas could lead to an improvement in the quality of care patients receive. For example, EEG monitoring, which was absent in all clinics, could mean lower doses being given and subsequently, fewer cognitive side-effects.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> One way of improving these areas could be by nominating a consultant psychiatrist (in our sample, this happened in only 60% of the ECT clinics) and a nurse who are responsible for ECT delivery, oversee its practice and audit it.</p><p id="P28">Bilateral ECT was performed on all patients in compliance with the Iraqi ECT Policy, which stipulates that bilateral ECT should be used except in patients under the age of 18 (only one patient in our sample) or in elderly patients with cognitive impairment. Bilateral use of ECT seems to be the norm in many countries.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><sec id="S4"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P29">One limitation of our study is that we did not collect data about the number of ECT sessions given to each patient. This information could inform us about Iraqi practice in that area, but not necessarily in measuring compliance with the policy, which does not include a standard about the number of ECT sessions. Another limitation is that we did not record how many of the consent forms were signed by patients as opposed to relatives. This could have shed light on transcultural differences in that area. In Iraq, giving consent by the family on behalf of the patient is seen as acceptable. This is something which needs to be explored further in the absence of an active mental health act. This audit has not covered ECT practice in private clinics. We know from personal contact that this is not uncommon but it is not governed by any policy. Regulations might need to be enforced to ensure good practice. We did not collect data about who administered the ECT treatments; however, we know that in Iraq ECT is administered by a psychiatry specialist or a trainee.</p><p id="P30">The recent history of Iraq has been very traumatic, with three wars, years of economic sanctions and more than 11 years of civil unrest. These major events have affected the health services', including mental health services', infrastructure. Since 2003, there have been attempts to improve and modernise mental health services in collaboration with international bodies such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists through its Iraq Sub Committee. This subcommittee has contributed to many projects,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> for example drafting the ECT standards. This audit has examined the practice of ECT in Iraq against these standards and identified areas for further improvement. There are resource issues that need to be addressed by the Ministry of Health and areas which could be improved by training or research. In particular, the use of ECT in schizophrenia needs further exploration.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p id="P31">We thank the medical directors and heads of departments who answered the questionnaire.
