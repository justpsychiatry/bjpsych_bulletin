Low treatment response in refugees is often attributed to patient-related factors,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> such as trauma history, current stressors and complex psychopathology. Many asylum seekers and refugees have been exposed to multiple, prolonged, interpersonal traumatic events such as war and human trafficking.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In addition, they have to handle the stress of forced migration, including involvement in legal procedures<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and loss of their home country, cultural resources, family and social status.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Apart from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> they may experience comorbid symptoms including depression, anxiety and psychosis,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> as well as symptoms sometimes referred to as complex PTSD.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> By contrast, some clinicians argue that it is the treatment offered to refugees, rather than their potential to benefit from treatment, that leads to low treatment response,<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and that refugees, like other adults with chronic PTSD,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> should be treated with trauma-focused interventions. One way to examine treatment response in refugees is by comparing the effectiveness of different kinds of treatment in refugee samples. In recent years, randomised trials have shown promising effects for trauma-focused treatment in refugees.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Another way to examine treatment response is to compare the effectiveness of treatment in refugee samples and non-refugee samples. This has been done little, if at all. This study's aim is to compare traumatised asylum seekers' and refugees' response to treatment as usual with that of another multiply traumatised population: indivduals affected by profession-related trauma (i.e. military veterans and police officers).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><sec id="S2"><title>Setting</title><p id="P6">Data were collected in Foundation Centrum '45, a Dutch mental health institute specialising in treatment of complex psychotrauma. Specific populations include asylum seekers and refugees, veterans of various peace missions, World War II resistance fighters as well as concentration camp survivors and their offspring, and police officers. Centrum '45 receives national referrals of patients who, owing to their psychosocial complexity, cannot be treated in general mental healthcare or who have shown insufficient response to treatment in general mental healthcare. Treatment for PTSD (individually or in groups) generally consists of a combination of supportive therapy, pharmacotherapy and trauma-focused therapy, particularly eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR),<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> narrative exposure therapy (NET)<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and brief eclectic psychotherapy for PTSD (BEPP).<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> As these three trauma-focused treatments are evidence based, choice of treatment mainly depends on the therapist's training. Art therapy, psychomotor therapy and music therapy are also offered, especially to patients who follow a clinical or day-clinical programme.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Assessments</title><p id="P7">To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment as usual, Centrum '45 has routinely administered assessments at intake and at the end of treatment. Since 2007, a routine outcome monitoring (ROM) assessment 1 year after intake has been added for all patient populations. Since its introduction, ROM response has increased from around 40 to 55% in 2012. For several years, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ)<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> was used as a ROM instrument with refugees and for a shorter period also with non-refugee populations. The HTQ has been specifically designed for use with refugee populations. It is a self-report instrument that consists of two parts: one focusing on traumatic events and one on symptoms of post-traumatic stress (specific to DSM-IV<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and additional symptoms reported by traumatised refugees). Symptoms are rated on a four-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). A mean score of 2.5 has been recommended as cut-off score for PTSD,<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> although this recommendation has not been validated in a wide range of patient populations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Sample</title><p id="P8">To answer our research question, we had at our disposal a ROM data-set that consisted of 577 patients who had completed assessments both at intake and 1 year after intake (with a range of 8 to 16 months). From this data-set, we excluded all partners and children of war-affected persons (<italic>n</italic> = 218; primarily children of parents traumatised in World War II) because their reasons for seeking help, generally speaking, do not include PTSD. We then excluded all patients who at intake had not been administered the HTQ (<italic>n</italic> = 125) but another instrument to assess PTSD (a Dutch self-rating inventory for PTSD).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> As the final dataset contained only a small number of patients traumatised during World War II (<italic>n</italic> = 7), we also excluded those patients. The final data-set consisted of 227 patients who had had their second assessment between March 2007 and April 2013. We divided the sample into three groups: asylum seekers/temporary refugees (i.e. those who are still awaiting the decision on their asylum application and those who have obtained temporary refugee status, which may not be extended after 5 years), resettled refugees (i.e. those who have obtained permanent refugee status or subsequent Dutch nationality), and patients with profession-related trauma (i.e. military veterans and police officers).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P9">All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 for Windows. Demographical and clinical characteristics were calculated, and chi-squared and <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted to check for demographical and clinical differences between the groups. For the HTQ, mean PTSD severity at intake (T1) and one year after intake (T2) was computed as well as the difference between the two (PTSD symptom reduction). We checked HTQ variables for extreme outliers, but we found none. Missing data for the HTQ consisted of missing mean scores at T2 for 7 patients (2 asylum seekers/temporary refugees and 5 resettled refugees) and missing events scores at T1 for 42 patients (4 asylum seekers/temporary refugees, 34 resettled refugees and 4 professionals). We handled missing data by using pair-wise deletion.</p><p id="P10">We conducted pair-wise <italic>t</italic>-tests to determine treatment response within each group, and calculated by hand the effect sizes (&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>). Following Cohen, we interpreted &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 to be a small effect, &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.06 as moderate and &#x003b7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.14 as large.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> We set confidence intervals at 95%.

Interventions that focus on improving quality of life rather than on further symptom reduction, such as acceptance and commitment therapy,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> might be useful for those patients who despite prolonged treatment continue to suffer from clinically significant PTSD. Clinicians sometimes suspect asylum seekers to exaggerate symptoms to remain in medical care and thereby increase the chance of obtaining a refugee status. We found no substantiation for this hypothesis of &#x02018;secondary gain&#x02019; - in our study, not having a permanent refugee status was not associated with a decreased treatment response.</p><p id="P19">As for therapist-related factors, therapeutic skills that might suffice in trauma-focused treatment of other multiply traumatised groups might fall short in the treatment of refugees. Therapists might need more extensive training and supervision regarding choosing and staying with a treatment focus, categorising and selecting of target memories, and understanding and restructuring of trauma-related cognitions in order not to lose their way in the multitude of symptoms, memories and transcultural challenges. At the same time, therapists need to maintain a sense of being &#x02018;good enough&#x02019; to provide treatment to refugees with limited responsiveness.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p id="P20">Finally, regarding treatment-related factors, not all evidence-based treatments will work with all refugees. Therapists will need to explore non-response, and they may need to consult refugee patient populations themselves<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> to examine which treatment aims and techniques speak to refugees who insufficiently benefit from treatment as usual. In addition, novel approaches may be developed to enhance treatment response. Centrum '45 is currently exploring the feasibility of refugee treatment that focuses primarily on prolonged grief rather than on PTSD, and of intranasal oxytocin as a novel strategy to boost treatment response in refugees.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><sec id="S10"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P21">Although this study is valuable for comparing the effects of treatment as usual in refugee populations with those in a non-refugee population (which, to our knowledge, has not been done before), it also has several limitations. First, a division of the asylum seeker group into asylum seekers and temporary refugees, and of the profession-related trauma group into military veterans and police officers, would have been clinically meaningful but was not possible due to limited sample sizes for these groups. Second, some variables that might have shed light on differences in treatment response between the three groups (including comorbid disorders, the amount and content of treatment, change in refugee status and chronicity of PTSD) were not included in the data-set. Future studies should use a broader range of variables to more comprehensively assess predictors of refugees' treatment responses. Third, ROM assessments at our institute are completed by about 55% of patients, and findings might not generalise to our complete patient population, nor to traumatised refugees in general.</p><p id="P22">Nevertheless, our study contributes to the debate on refugees' treatment response by showing that it is indeed relatively lower than that of multiply traumatised non-refugees.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p id="P23">We thank Niels van der Aa for providing us with the data-set and methodological information.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
