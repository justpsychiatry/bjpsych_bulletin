  **Aims and method** To discern changes in body mass index (BMI) in
  patients on long-term antidepressant treatment in a general practice
  population and establish BMI changes in patients with and without a
  diagnosis of diabetes. We used a retrospective observational method
  and identified patients on four antidepressants of interest. We
  excluded those who did not have start and current BMI readings within
  the past 3 years and noted whether or not patients had a diagnosis of
  diabetes.

  **Results** Long-term treatment with citalopram, fluoxetine,
  mirtazapine and sertraline was associated with increased BMI in
  two-thirds of patients. There was reduction in BMI in patients with
  diabetes and an increase in BMI for patients who did not have
  diabetes.

  **Clinical implications** Awareness of environmental factors and their
  impact on individuals is important. Medication is not the only cause
  of abnormal metabolic effects. Overall monitoring of physical health
  is important in all groups of patients.

title: "Long-term antidepressant treatment in general practice: changes
  in body mass index"
---

Evidence from short-term studies and meta-analyses suggests that there
is an association between antidepressant use and weight gain,
particularly for mirtazapine.^1,2^ A prescription register study in
Finland showed that all antidepressants were associated with weight gain
and type 2 diabetes over 1-year follow-up,^3^ although it is unlikely
that antidepressants directly cause diabetes mellitus.^4^ When
initiating antidepressant therapy, our local guidelines suggest four
options -- fluoxetine, citalopram, mirtazapine and sertraline.^5^ An
important reason for discontinuing antidepressant therapy is
side-effects such as weight gain,^6^ however, developing literature in
adherence also suggests that side-effects have less importance than
originally thought and may not be a primary cause for
discontinuation.^7^

Our primary hypothesis was that mirtazapine would be associated with
increased weight gain compared with the other antidepressants. We also
aimed to establish whether there was an association between long-term
antidepressant treatment and changes in weight expressed as changes in
body mass index (BMI). As diabetes mellitus is common in patients with
depressive disorders,^8^ we also aimed to examine whether patients with
diabetes mellitus commenced on antidepressants experienced similar
changes in BMI as patients who did not have diabetes.

# Method {#S1}

We used an EMIS Web search
([www.emishealth.com/products/mental-health](www.emishealth.com/products/mental-health))
within our general practice in Larkhall and Stonehouse, Scotland, UK, to
identify patients on the antidepressants of interest. The practice
population comprised 11 994 patients, of whom 232 patients were on
mirtazapine, 456 on citalopram, 353 on fluoxetine and 221 on sertraline.
We excluded those who did not have recorded start and current BMIs. Body
mass index for each antidepressant was expressed as a percentage
increase upon the start BMI. The duration of treatment and any prior
antidepressants used were recorded to discern whether the antidepressant
of interest had been prescribed for a relatively short period of time
and whether any previous antidepressant may have influenced the changes.
A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus made by the general practice was also
noted. The project was registered with NHS Lanarkshire\'s Clinical
Quality Department. The results were tabulated using Excel 2007 for
Microsoft Windows, which was also used for the majority of statistical
analysis. For nominal data, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
corresponding two-tailed *t*-tests were used. For categorical data, the
χ^2^ statistic was used. Spearman\'s rho correlations were used to
examine the relationship between BMI change and duration of treatment.

# Results {#S2}

[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} shows demographic and clinical measures
for each antidepressant group. More females were prescribed the four
antidepressants of interest, however, the male/female ratio did not vary
significantly between antidepressants (χ^2^ = 4.1, d.f. = 3, *P* =
0.25). Patients prescribed fluoxetine and citalopram were younger than
those prescribed mirtazapine and sertraline (F~(3,264)~ = 17.1,
*P*\<0.001). The duration of treatment was longest with fluoxetine
(F~(3,264)~ = 19.0, *P*\<0.001). Around two-thirds of all patients
showed an overall BMI increase associated with treatment, with no
differences between antidepressants (χ^2^ = 1.4, d.f. = 3, *P* = 0.7).
The BMI at the start of treatment did not differ significantly between
antidepressants for patients with (F~(3,207)~ = 0.13, *P* = 0.9) and
without diabetes (F~(3,58)~ = 1.04, *P* = 0.38). Mean increases in BMI
were seen for patients who did not have diabetes and mean decreases were
seen for patients who had diabetes ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). No
statistical differences for the increases or decreases were noted
between antidepressants, although percentage BMI gain from baseline was
greatest for fluoxetine (10.3%) for patients without diabetes. At the
commencement of treatment the ratio of normal weight (BMI \<25 kg/m^2^)
to abnormal weight (all other BMI categories) was 1:2 for patients who
did not have diabetes and 1:8 for patients with diabetes (χ^2^ = 13.0,
d.f. = 1, *P*\<0.001). Looking at antidepressant history ([Table
2](#T2){ref-type="table"}), patients prescribed mirtazapine were more
likely to have been treated with another antidepressant beforehand (χ^2^
= 11.6, d.f. = 3, *P*\<0.01).

[Figure 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"} shows Spearman\'s rho correlations for
percentage BMI change with time. Significant positive correlations were
seen with fluoxetine (*P* = 0.03) and mirtazapine (*P* = 0.04). For
mirtazapine and sertraline BMI reductions were associated with short
duration of treatment.

# Discussion {#S3}

Long-term antidepressant treatment with citalopram, fluoxetine,
mirtazapine and sertraline was associated with an increased BMI in
approximately two-thirds of patients. There were differences between
patients with and without diabetes. In patients with diabetes, we noted
a mean reduction in BMI with all four antidepressants, whereas in
patients without diabetes there was a mean increase in BMI. Notably, a
long duration of antidepressant treatment was seen, in some patients
extending to almost two decades. BMI increases were positively
correlated with duration of treatment, reaching statistical significance
for fluoxetine and mirtazapine. Our primary hypothesis was not
supported, in that mirtazapine was not associated with the greatest
increase in BMI compared with the other three antidepressant
medications.

## Comparison with existing literature {#S4}

Diabetes was relatively common among patients in each of the
antidepressant groups, at 18--24%, which was significantly higher than
the national average of 6%
([www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html](www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html)).
This may have been related to a number of factors, including the
increased likelihood of depression in patients with physical health
comorbidity. In addition, patients with diabetes are usually offered
regular reviews for their illness and may have had more opportunity to
discuss mental health problems such as depression. Some studies have
suggested that antidepressant prescription is associated with an
increased relative risk of type 2 diabetes, although the elevation in
absolute risk was modest.^3^ From our data, patients with diabetes were
more likely to be overweight at the commencement of treatment and also
as a group to lose a small proportion of weight following treatment. The
mechanism for this may be that by treating depression, motivation,
ability to exercise and general physical health improved. Another
possibility is that people with diabetes were more likely to attend
regular review/annual health checks, therefore risk factors such as
obesity were more proactively managed. There was a suggestion that
fluoxetine was given to diabetic patients with the highest BMI --
perhaps the result of channelling bias,^9^ where prescribers actively,
or perhaps subconsciously, selected patients who had a relatively high
BMI to start with as being suitable for treatment with fluoxetine.

Weight change is a common clinical feature of depression and at first
glance increasing weight associated with treatment may, for some, seem
clinically favourable. However, our patients had a mean BMI of 30.1
kg/m^2^ before the start of their antidepressant medication, 2.9 kg/m^2^
higher than the Scottish average for adults, which was 27.2 kg/m^2^ in
2012.^10^ Our total population was by definition overweight,^11^ that
is, their BMI was 25 kg/m^2^ or above, even prior to treatment. Review
of the existing literature suggested that mirtazapine was likely to
cause more weight gain than other antidepressants,^1^ but our data did
not fully support this position -- surprisingly, we found that
fluoxetine caused the greatest proportional increase in BMI. However,
fluoxetine was associated with a longer duration of treatment, which may
confound this finding. This position with fluoxetine is of interest
given its historical use in the treatment of obesity^12^ and bulimia
nervosa (see the *British National Formulary*).

Interestingly, patients prescribed mirtazapine were more likely to have
been treated with another antidepressant beforehand. This may be related
to prescriber caution regarding adverse effects with mirtazapine, such
as sedation and weight gain. In addition, mirtazapine was the most
recently available antidepressant of the four in question.

## Strengths and limitations {#S5}

There were some important limitations to this study. This was a
retrospective observational study, therefore we cannot assume causality.
We excluded patient records which did not have two sets of BMI
recordings within the past 3 years. We may therefore have introduced
selection bias by excluding those who did not attend for regular review.
For the same reason, we may have targeted more patients with diabetes as
there was a requirement, drawn from the Quality Outcome Framework
(QOF),^13^ for this population to have at least annual reviews, hence
they would be included in our dataset of the past 3 years. There were
additional confounding factors such as comorbidity, previous
antidepressants, and other prescriptions such as antipsychotics,
steroids and thyroid medications, which may have had an effect on weight
gain. It is also possible that patients may put on weight as part of the
normal process, which is a further potentially confounding factor. There
were only a small number of patients who had two separate blood glucose
measurements taken, therefore we suggest that blood glucose results are
interpreted with caution. Having mentioned limitations, our data do
reflect a clinically relevant population sample and add utility in
informing prescribers and patients about specific metabolic effects
associated with antidepressants.

## Implications for clinical practice {#S6}

Antidepressant prescription is common in general practice. Data from
Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland^14^ showed that
antidepressant prescribing continued to rise between 2009/2010 and
2010/2011. The rate of growth increased from 7.6% in 2009/2010 to 8.1%
in 2010/2011. Daily use of antidepressants has grown from 6.9% in
2001/2002 to 11.3% of the population (aged 15+) by 2010/2011. We
considered the long-term treatment pattern for specific antidepressants
and its potential risks. We suggest formal clinical guidelines for
continuing treatment beyond the period of, for example, 2 years and
consider including such long-term treated patients in the general
practice register of those with serious mental illness. It is known that
weight change effects for fluoxetine are weight loss in the acute phase
(less than 1-year period) and weight gain thereafter.^2^ Prescribers
should be more mindful of the metabolic impact of all antidepressant
medications, particularly when long-term treatment is concerned, and
perform regular recordings of weight and blood glucose on all long-term
patients with mental disorders, not just those with diabetes mellitus.
It is likely that social, environmental and illness factors, as well as
medications, play a significant role in weight changes. Perhaps
encouraging healthy choices with all patients rather than targeting
dietary and healthy living advice at those taking medications
traditionally associated with weight gain is a more rounded approach.
The finding that patients with diabetes show decreases in BMI requires
further investigation and replication with a larger sample size and
other antidepressants.
