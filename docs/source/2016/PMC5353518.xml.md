  **Aims and method** To identify correlates between burnout and job
  stress of care staff at Leros PIKPA Asylum. Forty-nine asylum
  employees were assessed by Maslach\'s Burnout Inventory, a
  sociodemographic questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Job
  Content Questionnaire.

  **Results** Emotional exhaustion is related negatively to social
  support (*P* = 0.010, *r* = −0.362). Lack of job achievements is
  related positively to overall job responsibility (*P* = 0.040) and
  negatively to lack of job satisfaction (*r* = −0.430).
  Depersonalisation was negatively associated with support from
  superiors (*P* = 0.036). Employees with high levels of perceived
  stress reported higher levels of fatigue (*P* = 0.050). Positive
  associations of perceived stress with depression (*P* = 0.011) and
  sleep problems (*P*\<0.001) were also detected. Positive correlation
  was found between monthly salary and lack of sense of personal
  achievement (*P* = 0.020).

  **Clinical implications** It is necessary to address these issues
  through staff education and stress management.

title: Job stress and burnout in the care staff of Leros PIKPA Asylum 25
  years after the first Deinstitutionalisation and Rehabilitation Greek
  Project
---

Burnout syndrome comprises emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and a
reduced sense of personal accomplishment and is a major problem for
health professionals.^1,2^ A high degree of burnout is very common among
nursing staff.^3--5^ According to the demands-control model of Karasek,
the job content reveals that certain sources of job stress, high job
demands and low level of control by the employee over their work are
responsible for the stress experienced in the workplace.^4^

The staff of psychiatric hospitals and institutions are particularly
exposed to stress factors which are related to the nature of care they
provide, as well as the organisational frame of the psychiatric nursing
institutions. The emotional stress of taking care of patients with
psychiatric problems, workload, the feeling of control at work and the
social and economic rewards associated with work are factors related to
job stress and professional exhaustion.^5,6^ Specifically, staff who
have close, face-to-face interactions with patients and those with
longer job tenure in mental health were more likely to develop burnout.
A study of 510 psychiatric workers in 28 different units found that high
levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation were correlated
with negative attitudes (e.g. distant, rejecting) toward patients on
their ward.^7^ Another study of 93 nurses from 11 acute adult mental
health wards showed that difficult or demanding patients were the most
stressful aspect of their job for unqualified staff.^8^ Approximately
half of all nursing staff showed signs of high burnout in terms of
emotional exhaustion. Higher stressor scores were associated with higher
levels of depersonalisation. Reduced level of support and increased
administrative pressures were leading to an increase in stress and
burnout.^9^

The full extent of the problems arising from the provision of
institutionalised care only came to light in the early 1990s, when the
first deinstitutionalisation project in Greece for people with
intellectual, physical, motor and other disabilities was implemented.
The Leros Medical-Social Welfare (formerly PIKPA) Asylum
Deinstitutionalisation and Rehabilitation Project concerned an
institution for children with special needs on the Greek island of
Leros. This project was carried out under the direction of J. Tsiantis,
professor of child psychiatry. At the beginning of the project, there
were 165 residents aged 8--46, out of whom 32 (20%) were children and
adolescents up to 18 years old. Living conditions and sanitation within
the setting were found to be degrading and unacceptable, nutrition was
poor, residents were packed into 40-bed wards, and the number of beds
was insufficient. There was also a lack of trained personnel, a lack of
medical, nursing and physiotherapeutic care, a total absence of special
equipment or educational materials, and an extensive use of violence and
physical restraint by the personnel. At the end of the intervention
project, improvements in the care system and patients\' quality of life
in the Leros PIKPA Asylum were obvious. Following training, the care
staff changed their unacceptable care methods and negative attitude
towards people with disabilities.^10^ However, since then no other
intervention effort was pursued in Leros PIKPA.

Twenty-five years after the first deinstitutionalisation, the aim of the
present study was to investigate the correlation between job content and
burnout syndrome among the staff of Leros PIKPA Asylum. Previous studies
showed the significance of the application of intervention programmes
for deinstitutionalisation and rehabilitation,^10--12^ as well as the
need for supporting employees with high levels of stress and
difficulties in their workplace.^12^

# Method {#S1}

## Study design and procedure {#S2}

This is a cross-sectional study that took place between August and
November 2013 in Leros PIKPA Asylum on the Greek island of Leros. It was
conducted with the help of nursing managers at the four sectors of the
asylum. The head nurse of each sector distributed the questionnaires and
the study included asylum employees (nursing and administrative staff).
To maintain the privacy of the participants, all questionnaires were
delivered to the main investigator in closed envelopes. The inclusion
criteria were permanent employment in the asylum and no pre-existing
mental illness.

The study was approved by the PIKPA Hospital Ethics Committee (trial
registration number UoAMedPR-4716-180211-19) and complied with the 2013
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were
given a letter containing information about the study\'s aims and
procedures. The voluntary nature of participation and anonymity were
emphasised in the informed consent form.

## Measures {#S3}

All participants received four questionnaires: a sociodemographic
questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the Job Content
Questionnaire (JCQ) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).^13--15^

The sociodemographic questionnaire included the following: gender, age,
level of education, marital status, number of children (if any), work
type, work hours, monthly salary, previous experience at the asylum and
shift flexibility (ability to change shifts).

The MBI,^13^ validated in Greek,^2^ consists of 22 items distributed
across the 3 dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion (9 items),
depersonalisation (5 items) and the feeling of personal accomplishment
(8 items). Participants rated the frequency of burnout symptoms on a
seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 ('never happens to me') to 7
('it happens to me every day'). Depersonalisation represents the
interpersonal burnout dimension and refers to negative and cynical
confrontation with service recipients (patients). A typical example of
such behaviour is an inclination to refer to patients not by name but by
their bed or room number, or their illness. Cronbach\'s alpha
coefficient was 0.838 for professional exhaustion, 0.902 for emotional
exhaustion, 0.820 for personal attainment and 0.508 for
depersonalisation.

The JCQ^14^ was designed to measure the ability to make decisions at
work, work demands (psychological, physical), job insecurity, coworker
and supervisor support, and quality of life. The employees\' quality of
life includes the following subcategories: lack of job satisfaction,
depressive emotions, psychosomatic stress (fatigue, perspiration, and
decreased appetite and eating) and sleep disorders, as well as complex
psychosomatic stress (combined stress of the above factors). The
participants were called to indicate on a four-level scale whether they
agreed with the statements ('totally disagree', 'disagree', 'agree',
'totally agree'). The psychometric abilities of this questionnaire have
been validated in a Greek population;^15^ JCQ Cronbach\'s alpha was
0.878.

The PSS^16^ has been validated in the Greek population by Andreou *et
al*.^17^ Seven out of the fourteen items of the PSS-14 are considered
negative and the remaining seven positive. The negative part is intended
to assess lack of control and negative affective reactions, while the
positive elements measure the degree of ability to cope with existing
stressors. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1
'never' to 5 'very often'). Total scores (ranging from 0 to 56) were
calculated after reversing the positive items\' scores and then summing
up all scores. PSS Cronbach\'s alpha was 0.803.

## Statistical analysis {#S4}

Continuous variables are presented with mean and standard deviation.
Quantitative variables are presented with absolute and relative
frequencies. Pearson\'s χ^2^-test and Fisher\'s exact test were used for
the comparison of frequencies between two subgroups. Where dependent
variables were continuously scaled, we performed either a parametric
independent samples *t*-test, if assumptions of normality and/or
homogeneity of variance held, or a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test
(for the difference of mean values between two groups) and the control
of Kruskal-Wallis (for the difference between mean values of more than
two groups), if the assumptions were violated. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test or the Shapiro-Wilk test were used for assessment of normality.
Spearman\'s correlation coefficient was used to explore the association
of two continuous variables. All *P*-values reported are two-tailed.
Statistical significance was set at 0.05 and analyses were conducted
using the SPSS statistical software (version 19.0).

# Results {#S5}

Sixty employees of Leros PIKPA were invited to participate in this
study; 49 agreed and subsequently completed the questionnaires. The
basic demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in

From the statistical analysis of the demographic characteristics of the
employees (Table [2a](#T2){ref-type="table"},
[2b](#T3){ref-type="table"} & [2c](#T4){ref-type="table"}), it emerged
that higher salaries are correlated with older age as well as years of
work. The mean values of years of work at the institution and total
years of work were higher in male employees in relation to females (t =
3.605, *P*\<0.001).

The correlations of job content with the three dimensions of
professional burnout showed a statistically significant relation of the
emotional exhaustion dimension of burnout to the parameters associated
with psychological demands and stress factors of work in total ([Table
3](#T5){ref-type="table"}). Low emotional exhaustion was reported for
nursing staff with coworker and supervisor support. The dimension of
lack of personal achievements has a significant statistical difference
in the two categories of formal authority (yes/no) (*P* = 0.04), and
employees with low formal authority have an increased score in the
dimension of lack of personal achievements. High levels of
depersonalisation are correlated with lack of supervisor support (*P* =
0.036).

in [Table 4](#T6){ref-type="table"}. Emotional exhaustion was
significantly correlated with psychosomatic stress (*r* = 0.381,
*P*\<0.001), sleep disorders (*r* = 0.469, *P*\<0.001) and complex
psychosomatic stress (*r* = 0.525, *P*\<0.001). The lack of personal
achievements is significantly related to depressive feelings (*r* =
−0.283, *P* = 0.048) and lack of work satisfaction (*r* = −0.430, *P* =
0.002). Employees with high levels of perceived stress present with
depressed emotion (*r* = 0.358, *P* = 0.011) and sleep disorders (*r* =
0.633, *P*\<0.001), as well as psychosomatic (*r* = 0.480, *P*\<0.001)
and complex psychosomatic stress (*r* = 0.609, *P*\<0.001).

# Discussion {#S6}

This is the first study to assess the relation between professional
burnout and work stress in the Leros PIKPA Asylum. Our main findings
were significant positive correlations between emotional exhaustion and
psychological demands of work-related life stressors, psychosomatic
stress and complex psychosomatic stress.

It seems that psychological demands due to the nature of work at Leros
PIKPA may be responsible for emotional exhaustion among the nursing
staff.^18^ Furthermore, stressors that manifest with the psychological
demands of work combined with job insecurity lead to the emotional
exhaustion of the employees, since the workload is not matched by
rewards such as a stable workplace environment and potential for career
advancement.^19^ The expression of psychosomatic symptoms in employees
with emotional exhaustion is interpreted by the incidence of intense
stress at work with mental and physical health consequences.^20,21^ A
study by Kozak *et al* points in the same direction.^22^ It illustrates
that the negative impact of physical and psychological exhaustion on
employees providing care services to people with cognitive disorders in
Germany influences their health status, while being responsible for the
reduction of satisfaction derived from work and life.

Social support (from colleagues and supervisors) may be a protective
factor against the negative consequences of the demands of work and
subsequent emotional exhaustion.^23,24^ According to the model of
demands-control-support in the work environment,^25^ support at work can
promote the good health of employees and may be proposed as an element
of interventional programmes for coping with stress.^26^

In the present study, the dimension of professional burnout that
evaluates the employee\'s lack of personal achievements shows a
statistically significant difference between participants with or
without formal authority. It is possible that employees with formal
authority have the feeling of control over their work in contrast with
those without such authority who lack work control, a fact that can also
be reinforced by their lower position in the work hierarchy.

The contradictory finding of a negative correlation between the lack of
personal achievements and experience of depressive feelings is probably
due to intermediate variables which interfere with the above relations,
such as work object, age, previous work experience, education,
economical gain, and position in work hierarchy.^27^ A study among
nursing staff in China showed that employees with a high educational
level experienced more severe depression and job dissatisfaction than
those with a lower level of education.^28^ Depersonalisation also
constitutes a significant dimension of professional burnout among
employees having direct contact with patients presenting multiple
problems, such as those at PIKPA Asylum.^29^ Supervisor support seems to
have a negative impact in terms of employee depersonalisation, since the
majority have received a basic level of education and do not receive any
other kind of supervision in regard to patient care.

'Perceived stress' is a subjective construct of the stress experienced
by employees and it appears to be associated with feelings of
depression, sleep disorders, psychosomatic stress and complex
psychosomatic stress. The way in which employees perceive stress factors
may mediate the impact of job stress on the employee. In a study by Lee
*et al* of nursing staff in Korea^30^ the perceived stress mediated the
effect of job stress, resulting in the development of depression among
the employees. A future study could clarify the mechanism of the effect
of perceived stress on factors related to job content.

The limitations of the present study include a small sample size, which
affects the generalisation of the results to other teams of employees in
relative structures. The cross-sectional nature of the study highlighted
correlations between variables which are not all necessarily causative.
It is probable that there are other indirect variables that may have a
stronger acting role (level of education, earnings, possibilities of
progress, conflict of roles, quality of collaboration between personnel,
etc.). Finally, lack of a control group limits the significance of the
findings. Future studies should take into consideration the
methodological limitations of the present study and extend the results
related to job stress and burnout.

The results of the present study highlight the need for a stress
management training programme in an in-patient facility such as the
Leros Asylum. This is very important keeping also in mind the particular
framework in the Leros Asylum (lack of trained personnel and educational
material). Despite the enduring financial recession in Greece, we
strongly believe that in work environments such as Leros PIKPA Asylum
the application of programmes for stress management and the training of
the nursing staff in new models of nursing care can significantly help
the majority of the personnel.
