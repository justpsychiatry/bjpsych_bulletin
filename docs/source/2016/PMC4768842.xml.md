  **Aims and method** This questionnaire study aimed to investigate the
  reasons for choosing to specialise in psychiatry in a sample of
  consultant psychiatrists and core trainee psychiatrists from within
  the West Midlands.

  **Results** Five reasons were significantly different between the core
  trainees and consultant psychiatrists. 'Emphasis on the patient as a
  whole' was identified as the most important reason for choosing to
  specialise for both core trainees and consultants. Six additional
  reasons were shared within the top ten 'very important' reasons,
  although their actual ranking varies.

  **Clinical implications** Some of the reasons for choosing to
  specialise in psychiatry were shown to significantly differ between
  core trainees and consultants. Numerous key driving factors have
  remained important over time for both groups, whereas other reasons
  have been replaced with a shift of importance towards lifestyle and
  humanitarian factors for core trainees. Consequently, it may be
  advisable not to use the reasons that consultants gave for choosing
  psychiatry when thinking about how to attract today\'s prospective
  psychiatrists.

title: "Reasons for choosing to specialise in psychiatry: differences
  between core psychiatry trainees and consultant psychiatrists"
---

The recruitment and retention of psychiatrists is a long-standing
concern. The Royal College of Psychiatrists\' annual census in 2013
revealed that 5.9% of psychiatry consultant posts in England were
unfilled, with a further 14.8% filled by locums.^1^ Census figures
demonstrate a dramatic and unsustainable 93.9% increase in the number of
vacant and unfilled consultant posts since 2011.^2^ In response to the
long-standing shortage of psychiatrists, the College developed a 5-year
recruitment strategy.^3^ To increase recruitment it is essential to
identify the 'pull factors' which may then be used to attract
prospective psychiatrists into the specialty. Numerous studies have
considered factors associated with choosing to specialise in psychiatry
-- the majority have been carried out on prospective medical
students,^4^ current medical students^5-7^ and medical graduates.^8^
Interestingly, studies carried out on practising psychiatrists remain
few. A systematic literature search performed on Ovid EMBASE database
(using the following combination of keywords: psychiatry/or psychiatr\*
AND career/or career planning AND reasons) produced 21 results, of which
3 were identified as relevant. Two further papers were identified from
scanning of references. Of these 5 papers, only 2 studies were conducted
in the UK.^9,10^ This means that researchers have been neglecting to
utilise the strong pull factors identified within the population who
dedicated their careers to psychiatry. Moreover, both these studies
collected data from and reported solely on consultant psychiatrists who
on average had 21 years of experience in psychiatry.^9^ Considering the
rapid advances in the practice of medicine and the changes in the
employment environment it is questionable whether these factors,
influential 21 years ago, are relevant to today\'s graduates.

A study comparing reasons for specialising in psychiatry between core
trainees and consultant psychiatrists is required to better inform
researchers on the relevance of using consultant psychiatrists in such
studies and to identify current motives for choosing to specialise in
psychiatry to aid future recruitment strategies.

# Method {#S1}

A structured questionnaire was designed based on a model used in a
previous study by Dein *et al*^9^ (the questionnaire is available from
the authors on request). The questionnaire has two sections: general
participant information and factors influencing career choice.
Forty-five factors associated with choosing to specialise in psychiatry
were identified from a systematic review of the literature. A group
interview was conducted with seven practising psychiatrists to ensure
that as large a range of reasons as possible had been captured and this
resulted in the addition of three more factors. The final 48 factors
were included in section 2 (under specific headings: job content
factors; lifestyle factors; personal factors; experience factors), where
participants were instructed to indicate on a 4-point Likert scale how
important they perceived each factor to be in influencing their decision
to specialise in psychiatry. The questionnaire was then piloted, which
did not result in any further changes. All consultant psychiatrists from
Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust (BSMHFT) and all
core trainees (CT1--CT3) from the West Midlands School of Psychiatry
received an email invitation to complete the online questionnaire. A
weekly reminder email was sent over the course of 3 weeks. Additionally,
participants were recruited at core trainee training sessions and
consultant meetings within the Trust and completed paper questionnaires.

## Analysis {#S2}

Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and SPSS 21 for Windows.
The 48 factors influencing career choice were each analysed
individually. The data were non-normally distributed therefore medians
were reported and a series of Mann--Whitney *U*-tests were performed to
test for a difference between the core trainees\' and consultant
psychiatrists\' responses. The median for each factor was calculated for
core trainees and consultant psychiatrists separately. *P*-values were
adjusted by Bonferroni correction to reduce the chances of type I errors
due to multiple testing.^11^

# Results {#S3}

## Participants {#S4}

Forty-seven (42%) consultants out of 112 employed in BSMHFT in March
2014 responded to the invitation to complete the questionnaire. Of the
125 West Midlands core trainees in March 2014, 51 (41%) responded. The
participants\' demographic characteristics are summarised in [Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}.

With regard to the consultant population, years of experience working as
a psychiatrist ranged from 7 to 36 (median 20 years) starting from CT1
level or equivalent. The most common subspecialty was general adult
psychiatry (53%), followed by old age psychiatry (17%), forensic
psychiatry (15%), intellectual disability psychiatry, child and
adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy (4% each) and neuropsychiatry
(2%).

## Stage of choosing psychiatry {#S5}

The data are summarised in [Fig 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}. The timing of
the decision to specialise in psychiatry differed markedly between the
consultants and core trainees. Around 50% of consultants had already
made the choice on graduation from medical school and an additional 34%
moved into psychiatry from another specialty. However, the largest
proportion of core trainees (*n* = 22, 43%) made their decision to
specialise in psychiatry during their foundation years, with 37% of core
trainees having made the decision to specialise on graduation from
medical school.

![Stage of choosing to specialise in psychiatry.](21f1){#F1}

## Country of primary medical qualification {#S6}

Thirty consultants obtained their primary medical degree in the UK (64%)
and 17 (36%) graduated overseas. Of the core trainees, 34 obtained their
primary medical degree in the UK (67%) and 17 (33%) graduated overseas.

## Reasons for choosing to specialise in psychiatry {#S7}

Five reasons associated with choosing to specialise in psychiatry were
rated significantly higher (*P*\<0.05) by core trainees than by
consultants ([Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}; full table including
statistics for all 48 factors is available from the authors on request).
They were: the expectation that working hours in psychiatry are more
compatible with family life (*u* = 732.50; *P*⩽0.001); better working
conditions expected within psychiatry (*u* = 688.00; *P*⩽0.001); salary
(*u* = 707.00; *P* = 0.048); psychiatry perceived to offer a better
quality of life compared with other specialties (*u* = 758.50; *P* =
0.048); and opportunity to understand yourself better through working
with patients (*u* = 702.00; *P*⩽0.001). The remaining 43 factors were
not significantly different after correction for multiple testing.

### The 'very important' reasons influencing the decision to specialise in psychiatry {#S8}

The ten reasons ranked 'very important' in influencing the decision to
choose psychiatry as a career for core trainees and consultants are
shown in [Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}. The most common reason was
the same for both groups: 28 (60%) core trainees and 33 (70%)
consultants indicated that the emphasis on the patient as a whole person
was very important in influencing their decision to specialise in
psychiatry. Six additional factors were shared within the top ten highly
rated factors between trainee and consultant psychiatrists.

Factors identified by core trainees only.

Factors identified by consultants only.
:::

Factors within the top rated 'very important' reasons for core trainees
but not for consultants were: empathy and concern for people with mental
illness (*n* = 27, 53%); mental health considered an area of need (*n* =
27, 53%); and expectation of working hours in psychiatry being more
compatible with family life (*n* = 25, 49%).

Conversely, factors within the top rated 'very important' reasons for
consultants but not for core trainees were: that a career in psychiatry
would be intellectually challenging (*n* = 28, 60%); sense of fulfilment
expected from seeing patients improve (*n* = 22, 47%); and enjoyment of
problem-solving (*n* = 22, 47%).

Participants were asked to indicate other reasons which influenced their
decision to specialise in psychiatry, and these were: opportunity to
make most impact to society as mental health problems are common and
poorly understood (3 core trainees and 1 consultant); everyday variety
(1 core trainee and 1 consultant); interest in psychology (2 core
trainees); psychiatry professionals seem as amiable (1 core trainee, 1
consultant); easier to find employment (1 core trainee, 1 consultant);
and an interest in spirituality and psychiatry (1 core trainee).

# Discussion {#S9}

The response rate for this study was over 40% for both core trainees and
consultant psychiatrists. The sample population ([Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}) was similar to the UK psychiatrist population
in terms of gender and subspecialty when compared with the 2013 Royal
College of Psychiatrists\' census,^1^ and therefore it is likely to be
representative of UK psychiatrists as a whole.

This study highlights a shift over the years concerning the stage at
which the decision to choose to specialise in psychiatry is made. Over a
third of consultants came into psychiatry from another specialty,
whereas only a fifth of core trainees did so. The majority of core
trainees made the decision to specialise during foundation years, which
is likely to be a direct consequence of the increased exposure to
psychiatry in foundation years. It is noteworthy that a large majority
of core trainees in this study (*n* = 41, 80%) had a psychiatry job in
foundation years. This opportunity was not available to most
consultants. Kelley *et al*\'s study^12^ found that foundation doctors
exposed to psychiatry before specialty applications are nearly ten times
more likely to choose to specialise in psychiatry. This adds weight to
calls to grow the number of foundation psychiatry posts in a bid to
increase recruitment. However, interestingly, the proportion of future
psychiatrists choosing to specialise in psychiatry before medical school
remains unchanged over time, perhaps reflecting the handful of
individuals with an innate interest in psychological aspects of medicine
who enter medical school with the intent to take up psychiatry.

The percentage of UK graduates entering psychiatry has remained
consistent over time, confirming the extent to which international
medical graduates continue to disguise the long-standing
under-recruitment of UK graduates to psychiatry.

## Reasons for choosing to specialise in psychiatry {#S10}

This study has demonstrated that 5 of the 48 factors associated with
choosing to specialise in psychiatry significantly differ in importance
between core trainees and consultant psychiatrists ([Table
2](#T2){ref-type="table"}). All of the five factors were scored as more
important by the core trainee population than by the consultant
population. It is of note that four of the five factors are lifestyle
factors and relate to quality of life. One possible interpretation of
these results is that working hours, salary and quality of life have
become of increasing importance over the past 20 years. It may be that
the simultaneous rise in the numbers of female psychiatrists over the
years^13^ is responsible for the demonstrated differences in the
importance of lifestyle factors. Additionally, perhaps a cultural shift
in family roles has led to a growth in the number of men who consider
work--family balance an important factor when choosing a career.
Goldacre *et al*^14^ found that a higher percentage of graduates
choosing psychiatry rated 'domestic circumstances' and 'hours and
working conditions' as influential than did those choosing other
careers.

Emphasis on the patient as a whole person was the top 'very important'
rated factor for both core trainees and consultants. This is possibly
what separates psychiatry from other medical specialties except general
practice. Six of the top ten 'very important' factors were shared
between the core trainees and consultants. They are likely to represent
key drivers into psychiatry which have remained significant over the
years. However, the rank in which the factors appear in the top ten has
altered. There appears to be a greater vocational drive operating within
the core trainees to work with the underprivileged, with empathy and
concern for people with mental illness and mental health being
considered an area of need ranking joint second. This drive is not
apparent within the consultants\' reasons for choosing to specialise in
psychiatry, as their top ten 'very important' factors indicate more
academic motives for a career within psychiatry by the inclusion of
reasons such as a career in psychiatry being intellectually challenging
and enjoyment of problem-solving.

## Limitations {#S11}

This study was carried out among consultant psychiatrists and core
trainees within a single area of the UK. A retrospective survey of this
nature may lead to systematic recall bias which is likely to be greater
for the consultant group than for the core trainees. Direct questioning
may not always reveal true motivations behind career choice.^15^
Additionally, surveys are liable to socially desirable responses which
may have affected the results of this study.

## Suggestions for future research {#S12}

This study highlights a change in the stage of career in which doctors
choose to embark on a career in psychiatry. It would be interesting to
compare these results to those of core trainees in other specialties to
investigate whether this finding indicates a global trend or is isolated
and particular to psychiatry. Additionally, this study has identified a
growing importance of lifestyle factors when choosing a career and it
would be useful to discover whether this trend also appears across other
specialties.

This study establishes that the reasons for choosing to specialise in
psychiatry differ between core trainees and consultant psychiatrists.
Numerous key driving factors for psychiatry have remained important over
time, whereas other previously important factors have been displaced:
academic factors seem to have been replaced by more domestic matters
(work--life balance, salary and quality of life). The results of this
study confirm that it is not appropriate to generalise the consultants\'
reasons for choosing to specialise in psychiatry to today\'s prospective
psychiatrists. Today\'s recruitment strategies may be improved by
promoting the likely quality of life benefits that choosing a career in
psychiatry can offer in an attempt to boost psychiatry recruitment.
