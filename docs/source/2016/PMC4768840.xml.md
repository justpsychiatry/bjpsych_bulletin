  **Aims and method** The Maintaining Adherence Programme (MAP) is a new
  model of care for patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective
  disorder and bipolar affective disorder which aims to encourage
  adherence and prevent relapse. This evaluation, conducted by
  retrospective and prospective data collection (including patient
  questionnaires and staff interviews), aimed to describe MAP\'s impact
  on healthcare resource use, clinical measures and patient and staff
  satisfaction, following its implementation in a university National
  Health Service (NHS) foundation trust in England. We included 143
  consenting patients who entered MAP before 31 March 2012.

  **Results** In-patient bed days and non-MAP NHS costs reduced
  significantly in the 18 months post-MAP entry. At 15--18 months
  post-MAP, Medication Adherence Rating Scale scores had improved
  significantly from baseline and there was a shift towards less severe
  clinician-rated disease categories. Based on patient surveys, 96%
  would recommend MAP to friends, and staff were also overwhelmingly
  positive about the service.

  **Clinical implications** MAP was associated with reduced cost of
  treatment, improvements in clinical outcomes and very high patient and
  staff satisfaction.

title: "Maintaining Adherence Programme: evaluation of an innovative
  service model"
---

Non-adherence to prescribed medication is common in conditions such as
schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder^1,2^ and has important
implications for patients, their families, healthcare providers and
society. Non-adherence increases the risk of relapse, rehospitalisation
and suicide^3,4^ and is linked to impaired long-term functional
outcomes.^5^ The impact on direct healthcare costs, already
significantly higher in this patient group than in other psychiatric
populations,^6^ is considerable.^7,8^ Interventions which target
non-adherence to treatment overall therefore have the potential to make
significant impact on both healthcare resource use and patient outcomes.

In 2011, South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (SEPT)
implemented a new model of care (the Maintaining Adherence Programme --
MAP) for patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and
schizoaffective disorder. Its aim is to encourage treatment adherence,
prevent relapse and ultimately reduce rehospitalisation costs. This was
achieved through a joint working agreement between the trust and Janssen
Healthcare Innovation. The programme centres around the provision of
structured, in-depth psychoeducation, an evidence-based approach which
has been shown to reduce relapse and encourage medication adherence,^9^
with a number of other targeted interventions and support activities to
increase engagement. MAP is based on the Munich Adherence Programme, an
approach pioneered in Germany. An evaluation of the Munich Adherence
Programme Pilot demonstrated a 73% reduction in in-patient bed day use
and estimated savings of €5000 per patient over 12 months.^10^

This local service evaluation aimed to describe the impact of MAP when
implemented within SEPT to inform local decision-making about ongoing
service provision. The primary objective was to evaluate the impact on
healthcare resource use. Secondary objectives were to evaluate changes
in clinical measures and to assess patient and staff satisfaction.

# Method {#S1}

Patients eligible for MAP were those with schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder or bipolar affective disorder, with one or more in-patient
admissions (or equivalent stay in an assessment unit or episode with
crisis resolution home treatment (CRHT)) in the previous 2 years.
Patients with a primary diagnosis of intellectual disability, substance
misuse or personality disorder were excluded.

MAP comprised: assessment and regular screening of non-adherence by a
dedicated adherence teamstructured in-depth psychoeducation
(condition-specific) for patients and carerswell-being activitiesshared
decision-makingtelephone and text reminder servicesdirect consultant
access instead of out-patient clinicssupportive 'recovery lounge'
environment.

The 'core' programme consisted of 10--11 (depending on diagnosis)
condition-specific psychoeducation sessions. Beyond this, MAP structure
was highly individualised, following a baseline assessment of the risks
associated with non-adherence to treatment and ongoing review of
progress. Minor adaptations were made from the Munich Adherence
Programme: unlike it, the MAP did not include financial incentives for
patients or referring clinicians and depot injection clinics were not
introduced specifically for the programme (these were already well
established in SEPT).

## Evaluation {#S2}

The local service evaluation was undertaken between June 2011 and
September 2013; it was not part of MAP itself but an independent
evaluation of its impact. Patients who entered MAP between 1 June 2011
and 31 March 2012 and provided written informed consent to allow the
collection and release of their anonymised data were included (consent
rate was 99%, 143/145). Trust research governance approval was obtained.

Based on the results of the Munich Adherence Programme evaluation,^10^ a
sample size of 150 was chosen to show the expected mean reduction in bed
days of 150 days (95% CI 141--159). This was felt to be both achievable
and sufficiently accurate.

Data were collected for each patient both retrospectively (18 months
pre-MAP entry date) and prospectively (18 months post-MAP entry date) to
allow within-patient comparison of resource use. Eighteen months was
chosen to ensure that natural fluctuations in resource use would be
observed in both periods.

## Data collection {#S3}

Baseline demographic characteristics and healthcare resource use for the
18 months pre- and post-MAP entry date were obtained from SEPT\'s
National Health Service (NHS) electronic databases. Details of
psychiatric medications prescribed during the programme were collected
retrospectively from patients\' medical records.

Two measures were administered at baseline and approximately 3-monthly
intervals thereafter: the validated, patient-reported Medication
Adherence Rating Scale (MARS; scored 0--10, with scores \<6 indicating
poor adherence)^11^ and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)
severity,^12^ a clinician-rated measure of mental illness severity.
These scores and the frequency and nature of MAP contacts were entered
into a specifically designed electronic data collection tool by
healthcare professionals delivering MAP.

Patients completed short satisfaction questionnaires approximately 6, 12
and 18 months after MAP entry. Paper questionnaires were provided during
routine visits and completed in the clinic.

Staff satisfaction was assessed by conducting one-to-one semi-structured
interviews with all staff who had been involved in delivering MAP, when
it had been running for approximately 12 months. These were undertaken
either face-to-face or by telephone by an independent researcher.
Written informed consent was sought to conduct and audio-record the
interviews. Interviews were transcribed from the audio recordings and
sent to participants for approval before qualitative analysis.

At the end of the evaluation period, pseudonymised data from all sources
were sent to the external agency providing evaluation support, for data
analysis and reporting.

## Data analysis {#S4}

The data-set was analysed using Microsoft Excel and Winstat for Excel,
according to endpoints pre-specified in the protocol. Descriptive data
are presented using the mean (s.d.), median (range) or percentages, as
appropriate.

The Student\'s *t*-matched pairs test or Wilcoxon signed-rank matched
pairs test (as appropriate according to data distribution) were applied
to assess the significance of the mean within-patient change in each
resource use parameter (and overall NHS costs) between the 18 months
pre- and the 18 months post-MAP entry; also the change in MARS from
baseline at 15--18 months after MAP entry. The Wilcoxon test was used to
compare patients\' CGI severity categories at baseline and 15--18 months
post-MAP entry.

The costs applied to MAP and non-MAP contacts, to assess the impact on
overall NHS resource use and estimate the cost of the programme, are
shown in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}.

Analyses are presented for the whole sample, with subanalyses for
patients who remained in the programme for the entire 18-month
evaluation period (cohort 1) and those who left within 18 months (cohort
2).

Staff interview transcripts were analysed thematically by
familiarisation with the texts followed by initial grouping of
statements under the broad headings of the interview schedule, within
which a number of themes were identified.

# Results {#S5}

## Evaluation sample {#S6}

In total, 143 patients agreed to participate in the evaluation; patient
flow is shown in [Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}. Ninety-three patients
(65%) either remained in the programme for the entire 18-month
evaluation period (*n* = 91) or were discharged within 18 months due to
successful treatment (*n* = 2). Forty-three (30%) left the programme
within 18 months (mean 4.14 (s.d. = 4.57) MAP contacts per patient; 2.44
(s.d. = 3.18) months from baseline to last contact) and continued to
receive conventional care. Seven patients (5%) were lost to follow-up
within 18 months owing either to death or moving out of area.

![Evaluation sample. MAP, Maintaining Adherence Programme.](7f1){#F1}

Overall, 55% of patients were male and the mean age at MAP entry was
45.51 years (s.d. = 11.28); 59% of patients had schizophrenia, 27%
bipolar affective disorder and 13% schizoaffective disorder. These and
other patient characteristics are shown in [Table

## Resource use {#S7}

In the total evaluation sample, non-MAP NHS costs reduced from a mean of
£33 326 (s.d. = £34 772) per patient in the 18 months pre-MAP to £23 841
(s.d. = £30 311) in the 18 months post-MAP; a significant reduction of
£9485 (s.d. = £34 785; *P* = 0.001). A significant reduction was also
observed in cohort 1 (mean £9396 (s.d. = £34 444), *P* = 0.005), but the
mean cost reduction of £7297 (s.d. = £36 293) per patient in cohort 2
was not statistically significant ([Fig. 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}). The
cost of delivering MAP was estimated at £1232, £1708 and £270 (for the
total evaluation sample, cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively), equating
to net cost reductions of £8253, £7688 and £7027 per patient.

![Total cost of non-MAP NHS resource use. \*The total evaluation sample
includes 7 patients for whom 18 months\' follow-up data were not
available (because the patient died or moved away). Excluding these
patients (*n* = 136), the mean cost of non-MAP NHS resource was £32 939
(s.d. = £35 235) in the 18 months pre-MAP and £24 207 (s.d. = £30 666)
in the 18 months post-MAP, a mean reduction of £8732 (s.d. = £34 918)
per patient (*P* = 0.002).](8f2){#F2}

The number of in-patient bed days per patient reduced significantly in
the 18 months post-MAP entry, both in the total evaluation sample (by
24.31 (s.d. = 100.16) days per patient, *P* = 0.002) and in cohort 1 (a
reduction of 26.26 (s.d. = 106.64) days per patient, *P* = 0.01). In the
total sample there were also significant reductions in assessment unit,
assertive outreach, community mental health team (CMHT) duty and
out-patient contacts and in cohort 1 in assessment unit and out-patient
contacts ([Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}).

## Outcome scores and severity assessment {#S8}

Outcome scores and severity assessments are shown only for cohort 1,
owing to the small number of patients in other subgroups who completed
follow-up assessments. The mean MARS score at each time point is given
in Fig. DS1 (see the online data supplement to this paper). In the 84
patients with MARS scores recorded at both baseline and 15--18 months, a
2.24 point improvement (s.d. = 2.14, *P*\<0.001) was noted.

CGI severity was available for 93 patients at baseline and 83 patients
at 15--18 months; online Fig. DS2 shows the category distributions. At
15--18 months, 47% (39/83) of patients had a less severe rating, 11%
(9/83) a more severe rating and 42% (35/83) the same rating as at
baseline, a significant shift towards less severe CGI categories
(Wilcoxon, *P* = 0.004).

## Medications for psychiatric conditions {#S9}

Prescription data were collected for 96% of patients. There were few
medication changes during MAP participation: 6 patients switched from
depot to oral antipsychotic medication and one switched from oral to
depot.

## Patient and staff satisfaction {#S10}

At least one satisfaction questionnaire was completed by 81 patients (80
in cohort 1, 1 in cohort 2). Patient satisfaction was high across all
questions: 96% (75/78) of respondents 'strongly agreed' or 'agreed' that
they would recommend MAP to a friend with a similar problem (see online
Fig. DS3 for full results).

Eight staff who were involved in the delivery of MAP were interviewed: 4
mental health nurses, 3 occupational therapists and 1 consultant
psychiatrist; 3 had worked on MAP since its initiation (\>12 months), 4
for 6--12 months and 1 for \<6 months. Two interviewees had left the
service at the time of the interview. Themes identified in the
qualitative analysis of interview responses are summarised below.

### Positive aspects of the programme {#S11}

MAP enables staff to spend more time with patients and develop a
rapport, thus removing professional boundaries and resulting in a more
equal, collaborative relationship. This is reinforced by the emphasis on
customer service, care and respect, and the pleasant surroundings of the
premises. Staff are encouraged to provide a truly client-centred service
to enable shared decision-making. In-depth psychoeducation gives
patients valuable knowledge and skills to become independent and
empowered.

MAP has positive effects on job satisfaction, sickness absence and
personal well-being. It gives staff more time and freedom to respond to
patients\' needs, enabling them to 'do the job they were trained to do'
and make a real difference. Working on the programme is challenging and
educational, with opportunities to acquire new skills, increase
knowledge and share ideas through multidisciplinary team-working.

'MAP magic', a phrase coined by one staff member to describe the
programme\'s impact, was described as a 'positive change' occurring in
both patients and staff; patients become more empowered and less
dependent and consequently, staff become happier and more fulfilled.
This was described as a 'cycle of positivity', 'positive feedback loop'
and a 'connection' between patients and staff occurring as a result of
their changing relationship.

### Negative aspects of the programme {#S12}

The lack of administrative support for delivering MAP and difficulties
in identifying and recruiting patients were the only negative aspects
raised by more than one participant.

# Discussion {#S13}

The gender distribution in the evaluation sample (55% male, 45% female)
is consistent with previously published work which suggests that
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder affect men and women equally.^13,14^
Data were not available on the duration of diagnoses prior to MAP, but
the mean age at MAP entry (45 years) and most common age at disease
onset (16--30 years in schizophrenia and before age 25 in bipolar
affective disorder)^13,15^ suggest that for most patients diagnosis
pre-dated MAP entry by many years. Bipolar affective disorder appears to
be underrepresented in the sample (27% of patients *v.* 72% with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), given that anecdotally,
approximately equal proportions of patients with these conditions are
treated within SEPT. This discrepancy may be explained by an existing
and already well-established out-patient model of care within the trust
for patients with bipolar affective disorder or the generally lower
resource use in patients with this condition.^6^ There were some
apparent differences between the two evaluation cohorts; a slightly
higher proportion of patients in cohort 2 (14% *v.* 8%) were referred
from an in-patient ward and had Mental Health Act applications prior to
MAP entry (40% *v.* 24%). This indicates a more difficult to engage
group and suggests that there may be benefit in reviewing MAP screening
criteria, particularly the appropriateness of trying to engage patients
from an in-patient ward. More patients in cohort 2 were male (67% *v.*
48%), also in line with previous findings that male patients are more
difficult to engage and at higher risk of non-adherence.^16^

## Programme duration and dropout rate {#S14}

Given the nature and severity of their illness, it would be expected
that a proportion of patients would drop out of MAP. The 30% who left
within 18 months is in line with the dropout rates reported in other
studies of schizophrenia, which vary from around 13% for psychosocial
interventions to 43% for placebo-controlled studies.^17,18^ However,
although the evaluation period was 18 months, the duration of a
'completed' MAP has not been defined and even in cohort 2, some patients
attended a number of sessions (mean 4.14 contacts, range 1--22).
Although they may have benefited, it is important for future service
provision to understand why these patients left, especially since
pre-MAP resource use was highest in this group.

## Resource use {#S15}

In-patient resource use reduced significantly post-MAP entry (mean
reduction 24 bed days per patient overall; 26 days in cohort 1) without
concomitant increases in other emergency resource use. In fact, in the
cohort that remained in MAP for 18 months (cohort 1), assessment unit
attendances also decreased significantly and there were non-significant
reductions in CRHT, assertive outreach and CMHT duty team usage. There
are several benefits of MAP and specifically psychoeducation which may
have contributed to this: the improved therapeutic alliance, better
self-management of symptoms, improved medication adherence and
functional outcomes which in turn result in reduced symptom severity and
lower risk of relapse and hospitalisation.^19^ Irrespective of the cost
impact, this shift from 'crisis' to planned and potentially
community-based care is valuable both for patients and the trust. The
evaluation also shows that patients continue to engage with CMHT during
MAP, which is important, since MAP was intended to supplement usual
care.

The net cost reductions of £8253 and £7688 (overall sample and cohort 1,
respectively) are largely in line with the evaluation of the Munich
Adherence Programme, which showed estimated savings of €5000 per patient
per year,^10^ although direct comparison is difficult due to differences
in healthcare systems, observation periods and resource parameters.
Furthermore, in the Munich pilot, unlike this evaluation, approximately
40--50% of patients were switched from oral to depot antipsychotics and
it is not known how much this contributed to the results.

## Outcome scores and severity assessment {#S16}

In cohort 1, MARS scores increased significantly post-MAP and
importantly, moved out of the range indicating poor medication adherence
(\<6). There was also a shift towards less severe CGI categories,
suggesting improved outcomes for patients. The largest increase in MARS
scores occurred in the first 3--6 months of the programme and these
early improvements were sustained throughout the evaluation period. The
benefit to patients of the smaller score changes occurring later in the
programme (between 6 and 18 months) are unclear and further qualitative
research would be required to investigate this. Collection of scores
after discharge from MAP is also needed to demonstrate whether the
improvements are maintained.

## Patient and staff satisfaction {#S17}

Patient and staff satisfaction was a key component of the evaluation and
is vital in demonstrating MAP\'s long-term sustainability. Patient
satisfaction was very high, with 96% saying that they would recommend
the service to friends and family. Direct comparison of patient
satisfaction with this programme and other mental health services is
problematic owing to differences in questionnaires and respondent
demographics, however, in a recent national survey of people using NHS
community mental health services in England, 80% of respondents rated
their overall care as excellent, very good or good.^20^ Although patient
satisfaction in our evaluation appears to be higher than national
figures, questionnaires were only available for those who continued in
the programme and were likely to be the most satisfied. Qualitative
interviews with patients who left MAP would provide valuable insight
into their views on the service, the reasons for leaving and why it
failed to continue to engage them.

Staff were overwhelmingly positive about the programme, describing many
benefits from it for both patients and staff. Negative aspects mainly
related to a lack of administrative support for delivering MAP rather
than the programme itself. The importance of staff satisfaction was
highlighted in a recent review which demonstrated better trust outcomes
(patient satisfaction, mortality, infection rates, annual health check
scores, staff absenteeism and turnover) when staff are engaged.^21^ The
authors of the review concluded that a culture of engagement,
positivity, caring, compassion and respect provides the ideal
environment for patient care, and these emerged as strong themes in our
staff interviews. In considering the link between staff and patient
satisfaction, the authors cite the 'symbiotic' relationship of staff and
patient experience whereby staff who are aware that patients are
satisfied are more likely to view quality of care more positively
themselves. The cyclical nature of the patient--staff relationship was
also a key theme in the current evaluation.

## Limitations {#S18}

This was a local evaluation, not a formal research study. The results
are intended for local use and cannot be generalised. The sample is
relatively small and was chosen to provide a sufficiently reliable
estimate of the in-patient bed reduction in the overall sample, not to
detect differences in other resource parameters or between cohorts.

There was no formal control group as there are ethical and practical
issues in providing a control arm within the trust. However, patients
acted as their own controls. It could be argued that as patients with
one or more in-patient admission (or similar) were selected for the
programme, a reduction in resource use would be expected irrespective of
MAP. However, this is unlikely in these chronic and severely ill
patients. Furthermore, an 18-month evaluation period was chosen to
ensure that natural fluctuations in resource use would be observed in
both periods.

The benefits of the programme may be overestimated since prospectively
completed clinical measures and questionnaires are only available for
those who remained in the programme, rather than the whole
'intention-to-treat' population. Also, MARS measures 'propensity to
adhere' rather than actual adherence, which is notoriously difficult to
measure in any setting.

Overall resource use and costs may be underestimated since no medication
costs have been included. Furthermore, the evaluation includes only
resources consumed within SEPT and we realise that patients may have
visited other hospitals. However, these apply equally both pre- and
post-MAP entry.

Medication data were collected retrospectively from patients\' medical
records; this relies on the completeness of these records.

The evaluation was designed to capture the impact of MAP when delivered
as a package and does not show whether improved outcomes resulted from
specific programme modules, improved therapeutic alliance or the optimal
combination/duration of modules. A randomised study would be needed to
assess the relative impact of each component.

## Final word {#S19}

Central to MAP is evidence-based psychoeducation and targeted support
activities within a supportive and positive environment which aims to
help patients stay out of hospital and live better with their condition.
This evaluation shows that in this real-world environment, introduction
of this multifaceted and evidence-based programme to encourage adherence
in patients with severe mental health disorders was associated with
reduced cost of treatment, improvements in clinical outcomes and very
high patient and staff satisfaction.
