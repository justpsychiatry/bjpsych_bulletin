  **Aims and method** To examine how capacity is recorded in practice
  and compare this with the statutory definition, medical reports
  accompanying a random 10% sample (183 applications; 360 reports) of
  guardianship applications granted in 2011-2012 were examined.

  **Results** Clinicians did not explicitly use the statutory definition
  of capacity in 47.5% of reports. Over half of applications (56.4%) did
  not explicitly link the powers sought with the patient\'s
  vulnerabilities; such a link was less common in older adults (*P* =
  0.0175).

  **Clinical implications** Guardianship orders can justify deprivation
  of liberty. Therefore it is important that such cases involve a
  thorough assessment of the person and that due process is followed,
  including adherence to the statutory definition of capacity. Practice
  could be improved by altering the paperwork required of medical
  practitioners, in line with mental health legislation. In addition,
  these findings should inform current legislation reform.

title: "Medical certification of incapacity in guardianship
  applications: conceptualising capacity"
---

Mental capacity and consent to treatment are central to the practice of
psychiatry and, indeed, all branches of healthcare. Fundamental to the
process of making decisions on behalf of people who lack capacity is the
definition of capacity used. The problem of numerous, slightly different
definitions has been solved -- in theory -- by statutory definitions in
Scotland (by the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 (AWI)) and
subsequently in England and Wales (by the Mental Capacity Act 2005). In
AWI, incapacity is defined as being 'incapable of acting; or making
decisions; or communicating decisions; or understanding decisions; or
retaining the memory of decisions' (Section 1(6)). The General Medical
Council (GMC) explicitly instructs doctors assessing capacity to use the
statutory definition of the jurisdiction in which they work.^1^ The
legal framework in Scotland, England and Wales involves a presumption in
favour of capacity and an acknowledgement that capacity is decision
specific.

Following cases such as *HL v United Kingdom* (the 'Bournewood'
case),^2^ deprivation of liberty safeguards have been introduced in
England and Wales to provide lawful justification of deprivation of
liberty when this is necessary. No equivalent safeguards exist in
Scotland, where it is likely that a court will appoint a guardian.
Guardians can have welfare powers, financial powers or both, and can
make decisions in these areas on behalf of the person lacking capacity.
Thus, guardianship is a 'procedure prescribed by law', as required for
legal justification of deprivation of liberty under the European
Convention on Human Rights 1953 (ECHR). Article 5 of the ECHR (and the
UK Human Rights Act 1998 which is based on it) allows deprivation of
liberty only in certain specific circumstances; in a medical context,
Section 1(e) is the most relevant: 'No one shall be deprived of his
liberty save ... the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of
the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind,
alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants'.

It is unknown how clinicians conceptualise capacity in practice, whether
they record their judgement in line with the statutory definition, and
whether they link the patient\'s capacity and specific vulnerabilities
with the powers sought by the guardian. Therefore we present an analysis
of medical reports accompanying applications for guardianship and
discuss the definition of capacity used in the context of the powers
requested.

# Method {#S1}

Application for guardianship under AWI is made, either by private
individuals or by the local authority, to the Sheriff Court and the
application is accompanied by two medical certificates (see online
supplement to this paper) and, where welfare powers are sought, a mental
health officer\'s report. The core of the medical certificates consists
of four questions regarding: the clinician\'s findings, the likely
duration of the incapacity, communication, and consultation with
relatives, carers or others having an interest in, or knowledge of, the
person concerned.

The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is a statutory body which
works to promote the welfare and safeguard the rights of individuals
with mental illness, intellectual disability and related conditions. All
applicants for guardianship orders including welfare powers are required
to send a copy of the paperwork to the Commission. Of the guardianship
orders granted between April 2011 and March 2012, 42.7% requested only
welfare powers, 48.5% requested both welfare and financial powers, and
8.8% requested only financial powers.^3^ Correspondence received by the
Mental Welfare Commission is scanned and stored electronically on a
database, indexed by the patient\'s unique identifier. Data for all
guardianship orders granted during the year 2011-2012 of which the
Mental Welfare Commission was notified were extracted. A
computer-generated random number was used to select a 10% sample of
these applications and the scanned images of both medical reports
accompanying these applications were examined.

Details of the adult\'s age, diagnosis and the powers sought under the
guardianship order were recorded. The definition of capacity used was
summarised and it was noted whether or not the statutory definition was
used. Applications for guardianship will very carefully outline the
powers requested for the individual, reflecting the decision-specific
nature of capacity. Any link made between the powers sought and the
individual\'s capacity and vulnerability was examined along with
reference to the principles of AWI and whether the two reports were
congruent.

The characteristics of the sample and all applications were compared
with χ^2^-tests for categorical variables and *t*-tests for continuous
variables. All analyses used R for Windows version 2.15.2
(<http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/2.15.2/>). In a
supplementary analysis, reports for individuals aged 65 and over were
compared with those for younger individuals.

# Results {#S2}

A total of 1821 welfare guardianship orders were granted during the
study period and reported to the Mental Welfare Commission; a random
sample of 183 applications (360 reports -- some applications were
accompanied by a single medical report) were included in the study.
Characteristics of the sample and the total guardianship orders granted
are shown in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}. There were no differences
in the distribution of characteristics in the sample compared with all
applications. More than half were for women (59.6%) and there was a wide
spread of ages, although 54.1% of applications related to an adult over
the age of 65 years. The majority of applications were made by private
individuals (74.3%) and more than half requested welfare and financial
powers (57.4%). A substantial proportion of applications (45.4%)
requested an indefinite duration of guardianship. Dementia was the most
common condition causing the incapacity and, with intellectual
disability (the next most common), constituted 84.2% of applications.
Applications from all health board areas were examined, with the
exception of Shetland and the Western Isles which had very small numbers
of applications granted in the study period, none of which were randomly
selected for inclusion.

:::

There was disagreement between the two medical reports for 26
individuals (14.1%), either in the record of powers requested or the
diagnosis. Eleven applications (6.0%) had either only one report (as can
be the case for renewal of guardianship) or had pages missing from the
electronic record as a result of clerical error; there is no reason to
suspect bias as a result of these missing data. The powers requested
were blank on one report in three applications and once for both
reports.

## Definition of capacity {#S3}

Clinicians did not explicitly use the statutory definition of capacity
in 171 reports (47.5%). Of the 182 reports which did use a definition of
capacity in line with AWI (7 reports were missing the relevant pages),
the vast majority (127; 35.3% of total) referred to making decisions
either as the sole basis for incapacity (*n* = 106) or in combination
with other aspects of the definition (*n* = 21). Thirteen reports (3.6%)
included a blanket statement referring to the entire statutory
definition, on occasions quoting verbatim from AWI. A number of reports
were couched in terms of insight into the person\'s illness or even
referred to the 'significantly impaired decision making ability'
required for compulsory treatment under the Mental Health (Care &
Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.

A total of 188 reports concerned an adult aged 65 years or older
(excluding 7 reports which were missing relevant information), of which
only 10 (5.3%) were not associated with a diagnosis of dementia or
cognitive impairment (these applications concerned people with
schizophrenia or intellectual disability). Of these reports concerning
older adults, 88 (46.8%) explicitly used the statutory definition of
capacity compared with 96/165 (58.2%) reports concerning adults under 65
years (χ^2^ = 4.1, *P* = 0.0426).

## Linking powers sought with capacity or vulnerability {#S4}

The powers sought in the guardianship application were explicitly linked
with the adult\'s capacity and/or vulnerability in 157 reports (43.6%)
-- 92/165 concerning adults under 65 years and 65/188 concerning adults
aged 65 or older (55.8% *v*. 34.6%; χ^2^ = 5.7, *P* = 0.0175). Some
reports provided explicit examples -- sometimes extensive lists -- of
areas where the individual lacked capacity and highlighted the risks if
welfare or financial powers were not in place under a guardianship
order. In contrast, other reports -- where there was any link made
between capacity and the powers sought -- had vague statements along the
lines of 'I believe \[the adult\] is unable to make decisions regarding
matters of financial or personal welfare'.

# Discussion {#S5}

Almost half of all medical reports accompanying guardianship orders in
the present sample did not use or refer to the statutory definition of
capacity and, of those that did, most only referred to the ability to
make decisions, rather than the fuller definition in AWI. There was
disagreement between the medical reports in approximately 14% of
applications. Fewer than half of the medical reports were explicit in
linking the powers sought with the adult\'s capacity or vulnerabilities.
Applications regarding older adults, who may be subjected to the
greatest deprivation of liberty, were even less likely to use the
statutory definition of capacity or link the powers and the
individual\'s vulnerability.

## Capacity and deprivation of liberty {#S6}

As mentioned above, guardianship is a procedure prescribed by law -- as
required by the ECHR -- to authorise deprivation of liberty in
non-hospital care settings. In this context, it is similar in status to
the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards in England and Wales. Since
depriving an individual of their liberty is such a serious matter, it is
essential that the capacity assessment at the core of a guardianship
application is conducted in line with the statutory definition laid down
in AWI. However, despite the recognition that capacity is decision
specific, there were 26 applications (14.1%) included in this study
where the powers requested according to the two medical reports or the
diagnosis did not agree, suggesting that at least one of the assessing
doctors was not clear what powers were being requested in the
guardianship order or even about the patient\'s condition.

In England and Wales the requirements for the need for the Deprivation
of Liberty Safeguards are interpreted inconsistently and their use is
patchy.^4^ Also, the interface with mental health legislation is
problematic.^5^ Similarly in Scotland, both the use of guardianship and
the mental health act pose problems of interpretation and
implementation.^6^

## Legislative framework {#S7}

In Scotland there was recently a consultation gathering opinion from all
stakeholders as to how deprivation of liberty should be identified and
managed in legislation.^7^ This consultation paper (and the Scottish Law
Commission\'s final report^8^) contains detailed discussion of the legal
situation in Scotland, the rest of the UK and elsewhere concerning
people who lack capacity. In the *Muldoon* case Sheriff Baird was of the
opinion, following the *Bournewood* judgments, that the least
restrictive option regarding a person who lacked capacity but who was
compliant was guardianship.^9^ Subsequent Scottish legislation (Adult
Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007) has attempted to clarify how
local authorities deal with adults with incapacity but the situation
remains unclear -- centring around the question of what constitutes
deprivation of liberty. The Scottish Law Commission consultation
paper^7^ is the start of a process asking questions about whether there
needs to be a change in legislation regarding this group of patients
and, if so, what form this change needs to take. Indeed, it is likely
that all systems will have to adapt to provide a more appropriate
response for this vulnerable group of people. However, the implications
of requiring guardianship in all cases where an individual lacks
capacity would be substantial, particularly considering projected
demographic changes.

## Are things improving? {#S8}

Shortly after AWI was introduced, the Mental Welfare Commission for
Scotland carried out a similar analysis of 167 medical certificates
accompanying applications for welfare guardianship between April 2002
and February 2003.^10^ This analysis found that 49% of applications drew
attention to an individual\'s vulnerability rather than simply stating
that they lacked capacity, higher than the 43.6% found in the present
study. The two medical reports were found to disagree in 23% of cases,
suggesting that this aspect of guardianship applications has improved.
However, we can see that over a decade since the previous analysis,
capacity assessment for guardianship applications has not become
markedly better in terms of adherence to the statutory framework.

## Implications of this study {#S9}

In the forms examined, detailed descriptions of an individual\'s
capacity and specific vulnerabilities linked with the powers sought in
the application were not universally recorded. Indeed, the forms
completed by medical practitioners to accompany guardianship
applications (see the online supplement to this paper) do not encourage
this. In contrast to the extensive paperwork completed to detain someone
under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, there
is relatively little information required from doctors completing the
forms -- it is possible to complete the paperwork correctly while giving
very little information. Admittedly, these often accompany an extensive
report by a mental health officer but the disparity is still striking.
Revised forms which require more relevant details to be collected would
provide more robust justification for consequent deprivation of liberty.
A revised form for medical recommendations should require individual,
separate statements about the adult\'s ability to act, make decisions,
communicate decisions, understand decisions and retain the memory of
decisions. Furthermore, the findings of the present study regarding
medical certification of incapacity should inform the Scottish
Government\'s current review of AWI.
