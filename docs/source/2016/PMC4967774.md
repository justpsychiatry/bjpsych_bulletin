  **Aims and method** This paper aims to review colleague and patient
  feedback from the 10-year period of the operation of the Royal College
  of Psychiatrists\' 360-degree appraisal system, specifically: (1)
  examine the overall distribution of ratings; (2) examine the effect of
  working primarily with detained patients on patient feedback,
  represented by forensic psychiatrists; and (3) look for a relationship
  between colleague and patient ratings.

  **Results** Data were analysed for 977 participating psychiatrists.
  Both colleagues and patients rated psychiatrists overall with high
  scores. Less than 1% were identified as low scorers, although there
  was no relationship between those identified by colleagues or
  patients. Colleague and patient feedback scores varied little between
  subspecialties including forensic consultants.

  **Clinical implications** Psychiatrists in all subspecialties obtained
  high scores from colleagues and staff. Working with detained patients
  appeared to have little effect on patient ratings.

title: Colleague and patient appraisal of consultant psychiatrists and
  the effects of patient detention on appraisal scores
---

To receive revalidation from the General Medical Council (GMC),^1^ all
doctors practising in the UK have to participate in annual appraisal.
This has to include patient and colleague feedback (360-degree
appraisal) at least every 5 years. Doctors of different specialties
participate in various systems of appraisal involving colleague and
patient feedback, including those organised by the Royal Colleges of
general practitioners, physicians, surgeons and radiologists (under
discussion but not yet finalised), and the GMC has produced staff and
patient feedback tools.^2^ The Royal College of Psychiatrists has
developed a system for collecting and analysing data from colleague and
patient feedback and have validated questionnaires included in ACP
360,^3^ which has been shown to provide a reliable assessment.

Patient feedback ratings of a consultant psychiatrist\'s performance may
be influenced by patient or consultant characteristics, or issues
arising from the therapeutic alliance. Psychiatrists are unique among
doctors as many of them treat patients who are detained and treated
against their will. This study analyses the results of patient and
colleague feedback received by consultant psychiatrists working in
different subspecialties and specifically forensic psychiatrists as they
work primarily with detained patients. It is hypothesised that
consultants working in forensic psychiatry will have similar colleague
ratings but inferior patient ratings of their performance when compared
with consultant psychiatrists in other subspecialties.

# Method {#S1}

Data were collected from the ACP 360 system administered by the Royal
College of Psychiatrists\' Centre for Quality Improvement (CCQI)
received between September 2005 and December 2014. To obtain colleague
feedback, consultant psychiatrists were asked to supply the email
contacts of a range of 15 colleagues from their line manager, consultant
psychiatrists, other clinical staff, junior doctors and secretarial,
administration and management colleagues. Questionnaires were completed
online on 46 items covering a variety of domains of consultant
performance, including communication, availability, emotional
intelligence, decision-making and relationships with patients and
carers, relationships with psychiatrist peers and external agencies. A
minimum of 25 patients who the consultant had had significant or recent
contact with were sent a standard letter asking them to return a postal
questionnaire, rating the consultant on 15 key areas of performance.
Each item was rated on a scale of 1 (very low), 2 (low), 3 (moderately
low), 4 (moderately high), 5 (high), 6 (excellent). Psychiatrists were
grouped as low performing if their overall score was less than or equal
to 3.

Data were analysed according to staff feedback and patient feedback
separately by the types of subspecialty. To examine the effects of
working with detained patients on the quality of their rating, feedback
received from forensic psychiatrists was then compared with the other
categories of subspecialties combined, referred to as 'all other
subspecialties'. This was because forensic psychiatrists work with
detained patients and the other subspecialties only work with a minority
of detained patients. Therefore, forensic psychiatrists were presumed to
work with detained patients and all the other categories combined were
presumed to work with patients who are not detained. It was hypothesised
that forensic psychiatrists would receive lower ratings than their
colleagues from patients but similar ratings from their colleagues. Data
were entered onto the SPSS (version 21) database and statistical
analysis was performed with non-parametric Mann--Whitney tests owing to
the data being not normally distributed.

The ACP 360 system does not collect any further information about the
participating psychiatrists such as demographics, so further analysis of
the psychiatrists\' individual characteristics and their influence on
patient and colleague feedback is not possible.

# Results {#S2}

Between September 2005 and December 2014, there have been 27 826
colleague and 20 543 patient ratings of 977 consultant psychiatrists.
Although some psychiatrists will have participated in more than one
round of feedback, this study is unable to identify how many have done
so.

The distributions of overall scores rated by colleagues and patients are
presented in [Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"} and [Fig.
2](#F2){ref-type="fig"} respectively. These ratings are clearly skewed
towards the higher ratings and yield a mean overall score of 5.10 (s.d.
= 0.293) from colleagues and 5.21 (s.d. = 0.362) from patients, where a
maximum possible score was 6.0 for both colleagues and patients. Low
performing psychiatrists were those whose mean scores were 4 or below (a
score of below the highest scoring range). According to colleague
feedback, 8 (0.8%) consultants scored an overall rating of below 4,
whereas patient feedback identified 7 (0.7%) different consultants
scoring below 4. There was no correlation between colleague and patient
feedback (r = âˆ’0.21, *P* = 0.522) ([Fig. 3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}).

Overall, there were 3891 returns of colleague feedback and 1765 patient
returns from 133 forensic consultants ([Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). Forensic consultants received an overall
mean colleague assessment score of 5.04, which was slightly less and
significantly lower than the overall score of 'all other subspecialties'
of 5.11 (Mann--Whitney *U*-test, *P* = 0.02). The overall mean score for
patient ratings of forensic psychiatrists was 5.23, not significantly
different than that for 'all other subspecialties' (Mann--Whitney, *P* =
0.305).

# Discussion {#S3}

This study has shown that both colleagues and patients rate consultant
psychiatrists highly, and that there is little variation in ratings of
psychiatrists by either colleagues or patients between psychiatrists
working in different subspecialties. High feedback rating scores from
staff and patients are not a new finding. With regard to psychiatrists,
the original pilot of the ACP 360^3^ yielded similar findings.

Multisource feedback tools in general obtain results from colleagues and
patients that are highly skewed towards favourable assessments of
performance of doctors\' practising in a range of specialties.^4^ This
study obtained multisource feedback on over 1000 practising doctors from
a range of specialties including acute hospital care, mental health and
primary care organisations, however, differences in rating scores
achieved by doctors working in different specialties were not reported.
Participating doctors were asked to provide lists of consecutive
patients seen, so as to minimise the bias of obtaining responses from
patients thought likely to respond positively. A study of multisource
feedback on the performance of surgeons showed similar high ratings by
patients (also consecutively selected) and colleagues, higher than the
participants\' self-ratings.^5^ However, these studies relied on the
participants to provide their own lists of patients. To be more rigorous
about the elimination of selection biases, Ramsey *et al*^6^ compared
the results of staff respondents self-selected by the practising
physicians in the USA with those randomly selected by their clinical
directors and found no evidence of response bias.

This study identified a small number of psychiatrists rated as low
performers: 0.8% by colleagues and 0.7% by patients. This suggests that
the instrument is able to detect some individuals whose performance may
be poor, although these are not the same individuals poorly rated by
both patients and colleagues, a finding which differs from the positive
correlation reported.^3^

With regard to the hypothesis that there would be no difference in
rating of colleagues and lower ratings by patients of psychiatrists who
worked primarily with detained patients (in this study represented by
forensic consultants), there was no evidence to support this. This
hypothesis was developed after staff working in the ACP 360 service
started receiving feedback from psychiatrists believing that patient
feedback would result in a negative assessment owing to having a poor
therapeutic alliance resulting from working with detained in-patients.
The relationship between detained status, the experience of coercion and
the therapeutic alliance is complex and none of these factors have been
studied specifically with regard to appraisal of a consultant
psychiatrist\'s performance.

The effects of patients being detained under the Mental Health Act 1983
may have a potentially negative impact on the evaluation. For example,
patients admitted to crisis houses rather than to acute mental health
wards reported better therapeutic alliance and higher satisfaction with
treatment.^7^ Further, there was a relationship between patients who
perceived coercion (related to both informal and detained in-patient
admissions) and a negative evaluation of the therapeutic alliance,
suggesting the relationship between detention and poor therapeutic
alliance is more complex than the legal situation of the patient.^8^
However, a study of in-patient admissions^9^ found that although
detention in hospital predicted a poor therapeutic alliance, the
perceived level of coercion on admission did not predict a negative
therapeutic alliance. Finally, in a forensic in-patient setting,
Donnelly *et al*^10^ found it possible for patients to reliably rate
interpersonal trust and working alliance. These studies suggest that
psychiatrists working with in-patients or detained patients may have a
more negative rating from their patients.

The failure to support our hypothesis of forensic psychiatrists
receiving lower patient ratings may come from a number of reasons.
First, forensic psychiatrists may have long-term working relationships
with patients (seeing the 'usual' doctor predicts positive ratings)^11^
and they may be perceived as serving a positive function, for example,
rescuing a patient from prison. Second, detention in the community is
now common and involves other specialties of psychiatrist, particularly
general and community, so other specialties may be exercising coercion.
It is of note that Campbell *et al*^12^ found that patients, but not
colleagues, scored doctors from a mental health trust lower than doctors
from acute and primary care trusts. This study when viewed alongside our
study suggests that there may be factors general to all psychiatrists
that influence patients\' ratings that do not differ particularly across
subspecialties.

It is known that patients seeing their 'usual doctor' are more likely to
give positive feedback.^11^ There is less likelihood that low rates of
forensic psychiatrists obtaining patient feedback are due to the same
reasons, as longer-term therapeutic relationships are more likely in
forensic in-patient settings. Other factors may include patients being
unable to complete the feedback owing to lack of capacity. This may
apply to psychiatrists working in forensic psychiatry and in psychiatric
rehabilitation, although those working in intellectual disability
distributed modified questionnaires which are not analysed here.

## Strengths and limitations {#S4}

The ACP 360 is an instrument with robust psychometric properties which
has been extensively field-tested. This study involved a large and
representative group of psychiatrists from a variety of different
subspecialties. However, owing to reasons of confidentiality, no further
demographic data (e.g. age, gender, place of employment) were collected
from the participants, therefore not permitting further analysis of
psychiatrists\' characteristics on performance. Furthermore, the
categories of subspecialty are broadly defined, for example that of
'general and community' psychiatry could include a wide variety of posts
including community mental health teams, acute in-patient admission
wards and psychiatric intensive care units. Thus there may be variation
in patient and indeed colleague rating within this broad category.
However, given the narrowness of the patients\' ratings and the probable
high number of consultants working exclusively with in-patients
contained within this group, a higher number of patients rating their
consultants at the lower end of the scale would have been expected if
detention status was to predicate lower patient ratings.

## Clinical implications {#S5}

This study has two important implications. First, it suggests that the
ACP 360 colleague and patient yield results skewed towards the higher
ratings of performance in line with those received by doctors practising
in other areas of medicine. Second, the appraisal tool does not wrongly
discriminate against the performance of forensic psychiatrists who work
almost exclusively with detained patients. It also is likely that
patients treated by psychiatrists from other subspecialties may rate
their psychiatrists in a manner which is not related to their detention.
This study is not able to confirm this suggestion and further work into
patient ratings of psychiatrists by individuals who have experienced
detention or coercion is necessary.

The 360-degree appraisal is a helpful means of assessing psychiatrists\'
performance when used alongside other measures and psychiatrists need
not fear negative ratings from patients when they work in services with
high numbers of detained patients.
