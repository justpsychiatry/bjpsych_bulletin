Suicide attempts led to delays in underground railway services; between 2000 and 2010 the Northern Line and Piccadilly Line experienced the greatest total delays (8484 min and 5521 min, respectively).

Although there was also a rise in deaths by suicide during that period, this was of a lesser degree. In their 2016 paper looking at suicide trends across the entire England and Wales railway system, Taylor <italic>et al</italic> found that male suicide rates had increased from 6 to 8.4 per million from 2000 to 2013, with the greatest increase observed between 2010 and 2013, from 6.4 to 8.4 per million.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> By contrast, female suicide rates remained relatively constant. Although previous studies looking at suicide attempts on underground railway systems have suggested a case fatality rate of 43 to 55%<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (compared with 90% on overground railways<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>), this does not fully explain the extent of the difference observed. Increased reporting of suicide attempts by London Underground staff may be a factor, as well as the introduction of preventive interventions allowing for the early identification of persons at risk.</p><p id="P17">TfL has worked towards suicide prevention since the 1990s.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This has included strategically placed Samaritans campaign posters and telephones within stations. More recently there has been further collaborative work with the Samaritans to train staff in identifying persons at risk, and giving them the confidence to intervene.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Additional interventions have included platform-edge barriers on the Jubilee Line and gates to prevent passengers from entering tunnels at existing stations, as well as use of video surveillance and markings/warning signs to prevent individuals from approaching the platform edge.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Presence of staff on platforms during rush-hour periods may also be helpful. The increase in the number of suicide attempts and deaths by suicide in 2008 and 2009 may in part be explained by the financial crisis of 2008.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p id="P18">The number of journey stages made on the London Underground increased from 0.976 million in 2004 to 1.065 million in 2009.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> There have been several studies exploring a potential link between higher numbers of passenger journeys and the incidence of suicide, with variable findings. Sonneck <italic>et al</italic> found no such association on the Viennese subway,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> whereas in Stockholm, Sweden, and The Netherlands, authors noted a positive association.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although Waterloo station is the busiest in terms of passenger flow,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> it does not feature in the top 20 stations for suicide attempts on the London Underground in 2000&#x02013;2010.</p><p id="P19">Our data did not reveal any marked variation in suicide attempts across the year, although there was a small increase in events during May to August, with a peak in June. Findings in other studies have been variable. Although Dinkel <italic>et al</italic> found no association between seasons of the year and suicide events,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> others have noted a small increase in suicide events during the summer months<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> or during the months of April and September.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Even though summer months are associated with higher numbers of tourists in London, it is unclear whether this has had an effect on the number of suicide attempts during those months. Although a majority of those who died by suicide on the London Underground were mostly resident in the city, the time of year of their death was not available, nor was the proportion of London residents represented among those individuals who attempted suicide.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Demographics</title><p id="P20">The stark overrepresentation of men in the 15- to 44-year age group (61.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 57) among those who died by suicide was in keeping with national figures (England), where the proportion of males is approximately two-thirds.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The overall gender distribution of suicide victims on the London Underground was very similar to that recorded nationally during the same period (2004&#x02013;2010), with 66.9% of cases being male and 33.1% female. By contrast, the proportion of females aged over 75 years was almost double that of males (6.8% and 3.5% respectively), although the numbers were very small and therefore need to be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="P21">This is the first study looking at the ethnic distribution of suicide victims on the London Underground. The predominance of individuals of White Northern European background (&#x0003e;75%) is significant in a place like London where people of White ethnic background make up less than 60% of the total population,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> in particular since 83.3% of individuals who died by suicide on the London Underground were resident in the city. Moreover, use of the London Underground is evenly distributed across different ethnicities.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> There are currently no data available on the ethnicity of individuals who die by suicide nationally, hence we do not know whether individuals of White Northern European ethnicity are also overrepresented relative to other ethnic groups. Similarly, we do not know whether individuals of White Northern European ethnicity are overrepresented in suicide incidents occurring across the rest of the national railway network or involving violent suicide methods.</p><p id="P22">In our sample a fifth of individuals had a history of mental illness. Unfortunately, no further data were available regarding their diagnosis, level of psychiatric care at the time of suicide or whether they were current or recent in-patients of a psychiatric unit. Proximity of stations or railway suicide &#x02018;hot spots&#x02019; to psychiatric hospitals has been highlighted as a risk factor for suicide in several studies,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> although the result was not found to be significant across the Stockholm railway system.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In their 1987 study of 100 individuals who had attempted suicide on the London Underground, Cocks found that 13 were current psychiatric in-patients, and 2 had been discharged within 48 h of the event.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Fifteen individuals had expressed suicidal ideation in the 24 h preceding the event. Although proximity to a psychiatric hospital was not taken into account in this paper, the presence of a history of mental illness in a fifth of those who died by suicide highlights the need for staff working in psychiatric hospitals to be aware of the proximity of any nearby Underground stations in their assessment of risk in patients.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Additional risk factors</title><p id="P23">In Stockholm, authors found that the stations with the highest suicide rates were associated with higher levels of surrounding drug-related crime.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown that consumption of alcohol or drugs was a characteristic of about 10 to 20% of individuals who had attempted or died by suicide on an underground railway system.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In the UK National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness, the authors noted that 54% of those who died by suicide and had been in contact with mental health services over the past year had a history of alcohol and/or drug misuse.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Intoxication with drugs or alcohol can increase the risk of impulsive and risk-taking behaviour and may have been a contributing factor in the incidents observed on the London Underground, including &#x02018;person under train&#x02019; incidents of accidental cause. Unfortunately, the British Transport Police do not currently collect this information. Consumption of alcohol on the London Underground is forbidden; however, consideration must be given as to how to manage the risk of suicidal behaviour or accidental injury in intoxicated individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Use of preventive measures</title><p id="P24">Several recent studies looking at suicide attempts on underground and overground railway systems have focused on the use of preventive measures. Diminishing ease of access to the track through barrier methods is suggested as an effective intervention, although Cox <italic>et al</italic> noted a lack of studies demonstrating this.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In Seoul, the presence of platform screen doors (PSDs) reduced suicides on the underground network by 89%.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> PSDs are continuous panels that separate the platform from the train, only opening when the train is in the station. Half-length PSDs (1.6 m) were less effective than full-length PSDs; however, full-length PSDs were 120&#x02013;150% more expensive to install.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The effectiveness of PSDs was also noted in Hong Kong.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Portions of the Jubilee Line include the presence of PSDs, which may be a contributory factor to the lower number of suicide attempts observed on this line relative to the rest of the network. The presence of PSDs would also reduce the risk of accidental falls on to the railway tracks, thus reducing the number of &#x02018;person under train&#x02019; incidents. Although the cost of installing these doors makes their presence across the railway network unlikely in the near future, their potential for significantly reducing the number of injuries or deaths on the tracks should be considered when planning future network renovation or expansion.</p><p id="P25">Other proposed interventions include increasing the presence of drainage pits, as mortality at London Underground stations that have a drainage pit was 44% <italic>v</italic>. 76% at those stations without, in incidents of individuals falling or jumping in front of trains.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> These drainage pits were originally constructed to drain water between the tracks in deep-tunnel stations. Installation of blue lights at platforms was put forward as an effective measure by Matsubayashi <italic>et al</italic> in 2013<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> but this benefit was minimised by Ichikawa <italic>et al</italic> the following year.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Another suggested measure is reducing the average speed of trains entering the station at peak times.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In Vienna, changing the way in which media reported suicides on the underground by making it less dramatic was followed by a reduction in suicide.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="P26">This is the most recent study looking at patterns of suicide on the London Underground since 1994. It is also the first study looking at ethnicity within incidents of death by suicide on the Underground, and the findings raise new and important dimensions when seeking to introduce preventive measures.</p><p id="P27">There were several limitations to the study: no data were available for deaths by suicide between 2000 and 2003 owing to changes in coding, and death by suicide could not be confirmed in 47 cases owing to the recording of an open verdict or the outcome of the inquest not being available. Because of the relatively rare occurrence of deaths by suicide on the London Underground the numbers used in the study were small, leading to possible sample size bias. The limited breadth of information collected by the British Transport Police meant that certain risk factors (e.g. use of drugs/alcohol or whether individuals were psychiatric in-patients at the time of the event) could not be adequately explored in our sample. The study is further limited by the absence of data beyond 2010.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P28">Suicide on the London Underground railway system continues to be an important public health issue. The widening gap between the number of recorded suicide attempts and deaths by suicide is encouraging and may reflect the introduction of preventive measures. Use of PSDs has been proven to be effective for both suicidal acts and accidental &#x02018;person under train&#x02019; incidents and needs to be considered when planning railway renovation or construction projects. The overrepresentation of people of White Northern European ethnicity among those who attempted suicide requires further exploration, as does the proportion of non-residents involved in suicide attempts on the London Underground across the year to better target preventive interventions. Finally, the collection of data on alcohol and drug use, as well as a more detailed psychiatric history, would help to inform further research and implementation of preventive measures for suicidal acts on the London Underground.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p id="P29">We thank Dr Neel Halder for his invaluable guidance and support as a mentor under the <italic>BJPsych Bulletin</italic> author mentoring scheme.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
