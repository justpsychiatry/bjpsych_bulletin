  Although the Representation of the People Act 2000 permits most
  psychiatric in-patients to register on the electoral register,
  transferred prisoners and those admitted to hospital under hospital
  orders remain disenfranchised by law. This article clarifies the
  voting rights of individuals receiving in-patient psychiatric care and
  contends that the selective disenfranchisement of some mentally
  disordered offenders is problematic, discriminatory and may breach
  international human rights law. There are therefore strong arguments
  for the UK government to address this long-standing inequality before
  the next general election.

title: Patients or prisoners? Time to reconsider the voting rights of
  mentally disordered offenders
---

By common law persons of unsound mind are neither permitted to stand nor
vote in elections.^1^ However, the Representation of the People Act was
amended in 2000 to enfranchise voluntary in-patients and those held
under the so-called 'civil' provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983
(amended 2007).^2^ This means that the vast majority of patients in
general adult settings retain equal voting rights to the general public
and can exercise their suffrage in person, by postal vote or by proxy.
Despite these changes the Representation of the People Act continues to
disenfranchise 'offenders detained in mental hospitals', meaning that
some of those held under the so-called 'forensic' sections of the Mental
Health Act are disallowed from voting by law. Determining whether or not
a patient detained in a secure hospital is eligible to vote is therefore
not straightforward, reflecting the range of circumstances in which
assessment/treatment can be enforced by the Mental Health Act ([Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}).

# The voting eligibility of patients in secure hospitals {#S1}

## Patients detained under 'civil' sections of the Mental Health Act (Part II) {#S2}

Although relatively few in number, some patients held in secure
hospitals are detained under the civil sections of the Mental Health
Act; these provisions are governed by Part II of the Act and refer
primarily to Section 2 ('Admission for assessment') and Section 3
('Admission for treatment').^3^ These individuals are not diverted to
hospital from the criminal justice system yet are deemed to require
secure care by virtue of clinical need (e.g. somebody whose risk of
harming others cannot be managed safely within either a general adult
psychiatric ward or psychiatric intensive care unit). Since the
Representation of the People Act now enfranchises voluntary in-patients
and all those detained under civil sections of the Mental Health Act,
such patients have equal voting rights to the general public (regardless
of whether they are being held in a low-, medium- or high-security
unit).

## Patients detained under forensic sections of the Mental Health Act (Part III) {#S3}

The forensic sections of the Mental Health Act apply to mentally
disordered offenders (defined by the Crown Prosecution Service as
'individuals who have a disability or disorder of the mind and have
committed or are suspected of committing a criminal offence')^3^ and are
overseen by Part III of the Mental Health Act. Since the Representation
of the People Act continues to disenfranchise detained persons in
pursuance of their sentences, the voting rights of mentally disordered
offenders are determined by which section(s) of the Mental Health Act
have been used to authorise treatment. Unsentenced prisoners (i.e.
persons awaiting sentencing or immigration detainees) and those held by
remand orders are still permitted to register on the UK electoral roll,
whereas transferred prisoners and persons detained under the provisions
of a hospital order (whether restricted or not) are disallowed from
doing so by law.

# To disenfranchise or not to disenfranchise? {#S4}

In *Hirst v the United Kingdom (No 2) 74025/01* (2005) the European
Court of Human Rights acknowledged that the right to vote is not
absolute and that British citizens can be lawfully disenfranchised if
the justification for this is proportionate and necessary to maintain a
fair and representative democracy.^4^ The UK government therefore
maintains that it is justified in rescinding the voting rights of two
main groups of individuals: (1) those presumed to be incapable of making
independent voting decisions (e.g. persons under the age of 18), and (2)
those who forfeit some of their civic rights by breaching the social
contract between individuals and the State (e.g. prisoners serving
custodial sentences) ([Box 1](#box1){ref-type="boxed-text"}).^5^ To be
legitimately prevented from voting, mentally disordered offenders
detained under Sections 37, 38, 45A and 47 of the Mental Health Act
should therefore conform to at least one of these groups.

# Incapacity to make independent and informed decisions {#S5}

For centuries people with mental disorders were presumed by common law
to be incapable of making certain types of decisions for themselves, for
instance owning property, marrying, engaging in business
transactions.^1^ It could therefore be argued that the Representation of
the People Act is justified in disenfranchising some mentally disordered
offenders because they are unable to make capacitous voting decisions.
Supporters of this assertion cite data from the 2010 UK General Election
which showed that only half of the psychiatric patients enfranchised by
the Representation of the People Act actually registered on the
electoral roll, and only half of those registered then exercised their
right to vote on polling day^7^ (compared with 65.1% of the general
public).^8^

**Box 1** British citizens unable to vote in UK general elections

-   Those under 18 years of age on polling day

-   Members of the House of Lords

-   Convicted persons detained in pursuance of their sentences (this
    includes prisoners serving custodial sentences and some mentally
    disordered offenders)

-   Persons found guilty within the previous 5 years of corrupt or
    illegal practices in connection with an election

This justification, however, is unsubstantiated. First, mental capacity
is not assessed as part of either the voting process or the decision to
detain an individual under the provisions of the Mental Health Act; the
supposition that some groups of detained patients inherently lack mental
capacity is therefore arbitrary and unprincipled. Indeed, the MacArthur
study demonstrated that half of those admitted to hospital with a
relapse of schizophrenia and more than three-quarters of those admitted
with depression actually retain mental capacity.^9^ Second, uptake rates
are unhelpful in this context since enfranchisement is as much about
giving individuals the right not to vote as it is about the right to
vote. The consequences of impaired mental capacity on voting are
therefore impossible to measure, particularly as there are several
confounding factors why the psychiatric in-patients already enfranchised
by the Representation of the People Act may choose not to vote (e.g.
lack of awareness, social exclusion, disillusionment with the political
process).^10^ In 2008 the Electoral Commission therefore issued guidance
that 'lack of mental capacity is not a legal incapacity to vote'.^11^
The Representation of the People Act is therefore unjustified in
disenfranchising mentally disordered offenders on these grounds. Indeed,
if the UK government were to introduce a test of mental capacity into
the voting procedure, a significant proportion of the general public may
also be disallowed from voting by law.

# Punitive disenfranchisement {#S6}

The more commonly cited justification for disenfranchising mentally
disordered offenders is the tenet that convicted persons in pursuance of
their sentences should temporarily lose certain civic rights as a
punishment for breaking the so-called 'social contract' which exists
between individuals and the State.^2^ This notion of imposing a 'civic
death' on convicted prisoners has been practised in the UK for centuries
and was enshrined in law by the Forfeiture Act 1870. Although the
lawfulness of punitive disenfranchisement has recently been called into
question,^4^ the British government continues to support its use.^12^
This may explain why the Representation of the People Act was amended to
enfranchise some mentally disordered offenders (i.e. unsentenced
prisoners and those given remand orders), but continues to
disenfranchise those who have been issued sentences by a court (i.e.
transferred prisoners and those given hospital orders). However, the
ongoing disenfranchisement of these patients is problematic for the
following reasons discussed below: culpability, purpose and lawfulness.

## Culpability {#S7}

Mentally disordered offenders who have been transferred to hospital
after sentencing (i.e. those detained under Sections 45A, 47 or 47/49 of
the Mental Health Act) are obligated to return to prison (to serve the
remainder of their tariff) once their treatment in hospital is complete.
They are therefore recognised by the State as convicted prisoners and
are subject to the Representation of the People Act\'s
disenfranchisement of detained persons in pursuance of their sentences.
Applying the same logic to those detained by hospital orders however is
problematic.

Hospital orders are imposed by courts where it is agreed (on the
recommendation of two doctors) that somebody who has been convicted of a
crime should be admitted to hospital in order to receive treatment for a
serious mental health problem. Those deemed 'unfit to plead' may also be
issued with a hospital order after a trial of the facts has been heard
in court.^13^ Unlike custodial sentences, the duration of a hospital
order is neither fixed nor determined by the type of crime which has
been committed; instead, the length of time an individual can be
detained is defined by their response to treatment (akin with those
detained for treatment under the so-called civil sections of the Mental
Health Act). Hospital orders also represent a permanent diversion from
the criminal justice system, meaning that individuals detained under
Section 37 Mental Health Act have no means of being sent to prison once
their psychiatric treatment is complete.^13^ The application of hospital
orders therefore calls into question the *mens rea* ('guilty mind') of
patients detained under Sections 37, 37/41 and 38 of the Mental Health
Act and challenges the legitimacy of punitively disenfranchising such
individuals.

## Purpose {#S8}

The Mental Health Act is clear that detaining somebody in hospital
should be therapeutic, i.e. 'in the interests of health, safety or for
the protection of others' and that an individual\'s civic rights should
not be infringed unless there is a legitimate and proportional reason
for doing so. Seeing as there is no evidence that disallowing an
individual from voting has any meaningful value, the Representation of
the People Act\'s disenfranchisement of some mentally disordered
offenders is incompatible with these principles. There is also emerging
evidence that keeping psychiatric patients enfranchised during periods
of hospital treatment is as an important way of reducing social
exclusion and enhanced recovery.^7^

## Lawfulness {#S9}

In 2005 the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights was asked to
consider the lawfulness of punitive disenfranchisement (in the case of
*Hirst*) and ruled unanimously that the UK\'s blanket ban on prisoner
voting contravened Protocol 1 Article 3 of the European Convention on
Human Rights (the right not to be subjected to 'inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment').^4^ Notwithstanding this judgment, the British
government has failed to amend its domestic legislation and continues to
endorse punitive disenfranchisement, citing that (a) the right to vote
is a privilege and (b) that the temporary disenfranchisement of
convicted prisoners serves proportionate and legitimate aims, i.e. to
prevent crime, punish offences, enhance civic responsibility and promote
respect for the law.^12^ However, given the stark differences between
convicted prisoners and those detained under the Mental Health Act it is
hard to see how any of these justifications apply to patients receiving
treatment in hospital (regardless of their legal status). Indeed, the
European Commission for Democracy through Law (also known as the Venice
Commission) has stated that excluding a person from voting on the basis
of a disability (in this case the presence of a mental disorder) is a
form of discrimination which engages Article 29 of the Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities.^14^

Despite mounting pressure on the UK government to widen the franchise,
the prime minister stated that he would never be willing to support the
enfranchisement of restricted patients (i.e. mentally disordered
offenders whose detention is subject to Home Office restrictions),
describing them as 'some of the most dangerous people currently
detained'.^12^ This statement is not only unhelpful (given that
disallowing 'dangerous' individuals from voting in UK general elections
neither mollifies these risks nor protects the public from harm), but
also serves to reinforce the stigmatisation of those with mental
disorders and the assumption that they are in some way less entitled to
the same rights as the general public.

Since the publication of the *Hirst* judgment there have also been
concerns that permitting mentally disordered offenders to vote may
unduly influence the results of elections held in small constituencies
which contain large secure hospitals.^1^ This argument is flawed for
several reasons. First, in order for minority groups to have a political
voice it is important that they are not arbitrarily excluded from the
voting process; this is a basic tenet of democracy.^15^ Second, given
that large secure hospitals such as Broadmoor Hospital only hold
approximately 200 patients, the outcome of most constituency ballots
would be unaffected by a change in voting turnout of this magnitude.^16^
Third, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that mentally
disordered offenders are more likely to hold unusual or extreme
political views compared with the general public.

# Conclusions {#S10}

Although the UK declared universal suffrage in 1928, the right to vote
in general elections is not extended to all British citizens. Whereas
amendments to the Representation of the People Act in 2000 enfranchised
those admitted to secure hospitals by remand orders and the so-called
civil provisions of the Mental Health Act, transferred prisoners and
those receiving hospital orders remain disallowed from voting by law.
The revocation of these rights is based on the 19th-century notion of
punishing convicted criminals with a 'civic death' (Forfeiture Act
1870), but more recent case law has established that the blanket
disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners contravenes international
human rights legislation.^4^

This editorial highlighted several key differences between convicted
prisoners and mentally disordered offenders; these differences render
the arbitrary disenfranchisement of individuals detained under Sections
37, 38, 45A and 47 Mental Health Act problematic, unhelpful and
discriminatory. Although the voting rights of psychiatric patients are
sadly unlikely to be high on the political agenda, there is an emerging
consensus of opinion that the enfranchisement of psychiatric in-patients
supports autonomy, challenges stigmatisation and reduces some of the
social exclusion facing individuals diagnosed with mental
disorders.^7,10^ If the government is serious about tackling healthcare
inequalities and creating a meaningful democracy in the UK, it should
amend the Representation of the People Act to enfranchise all mentally
disordered offenders, irrespective of the circumstances of their
detention.
