  **Aims and method**

  To ascertain differences in patterns of suicide in young men over
  three decades (1960s, 1990s and 2000s) and discuss implications for
  suicide prevention. Data on suicides and open verdicts in men aged
  15--34 were obtained from coroner\'s records in Newcastle upon Tyne
  and analysed using SPSS software.

  **Results**

  An increase in suicide rates from the first to the second decade was
  followed by a fall in the third decade. This was associated with an
  increasing proportion of single men, those living alone, unemployment,
  consumption of alcohol, use of hanging, previous suicide attempt and
  history of treatment for mental illness.

  **Clinical implications**

  This study highlights the need for more interventions and focus to be
  given to young males in the suicide prevention area and is of high
  importance in the field of public health. Areas that could be tackled
  include reducing access to means of suicide, reducing alcohol use,
  support for relationship difficulties, engagement with mental health
  services and management of chronic illness.

title: Changes in risk factors for young male suicide in Newcastle upon
  Tyne, 1961--2009
---

In a previous study in Newcastle upon Tyne, England,^1^ we reported on
the suicide profile of the population over two periods, 1961--65 and
1985--94, and showed a dramatic fall of suicide in women and a modest
decline in men. The only group who failed to share this trend were young
men (aged 15--34), in whom the suicide rate increased, a trend also
reported in other studies.^2,3^ We found that relative risk of suicide
(based on population data) decreased between the two periods studied for
divorced men of all ages (8.36 to 2.86), unemployed men of all ages
(9.57 to 2.34) and both men and women living alone (all ages; 11.91 to
4.34), whereas the relative risk for being single increased for men and
women of all ages (0.69 to 1.46).^1^

The aim of the present investigation was to examine this group of young
males in greater detail and over an extended time period. In addition,
suicide prevention strategies have become a focus of government
intervention from 1999,^4^ and we wished to find out whether anything
new was emerging in a new century and identify any changes in
characteristics associated with suicide.

Examination of coroner\'s records permits a more detailed scrutiny of
factors associated with a person\'s death and can yield information not
available from studies based on data supplied to the Office for National
Statistics, including analysis of which open verdicts should (or should
not) be included. Local studies, such as we describe, may become
increasingly important as coroners can now provide narrative verdicts,
but such verdicts may prove difficult for national data collection
centres to interpret in the context of deciding whether they will be
included in future suicide statistics.

# Method {#S1}

The study focused on men aged 15--34 for whom a verdict of suicide was
recorded by Newcastle coroners during three 10-year periods: 1961--1970
(period A), 1990--1999 (period B) and 2000--2009 (period C). Coroners
only record a verdict of suicide when this is beyond reasonable doubt
and otherwise can record an open or undetermined verdict. We established
from previous suicide research that it is important to examine cases
which received such open or undetermined verdicts^5^ to assess which of
these, on the balance of probabilities, could or should be included as
suicides for the purpose of research. Thus, two authors established
deaths as probable suicides based on information within the coroner\'s
record. If they remained uncertain then a consensus was reached between
them and a third author based on a balance of probabilities. Factors
taken into account included third-party descriptions of: mental state
near to the person\'s time of death, their past mental illness, nature
and degree of planning of a method of death, nature of any precipitating
factor to death, and autopsy findings. As two authors examined records
for all time periods an equal standard was applied across all decades.
Narrative verdicts, which do not specify suicide or open verdict, were
not found in any of the records during this study.

We obtained age-specific male population statistics for Newcastle for
the three decades to calculate rates of suicide. We hoped population
statistics would be available that broke this information down into
categories such as unemployment, marital status and living status, but
neither the Office for National Statistics, nor Newcastle County Council
or other sources had such information.

Only cases where the deceased person was officially resident within
Newcastle upon Tyne city boundaries at the time of death were included.
This was to allow comparison of the data with appropriate city
demographic data and to exclude records of non-residents who were
transferred to a regional medical centre within the city for treatment
and later died. Residents of Newcastle who died by suicide outside the
area of the city (and whose inquests were therefore held elsewhere) were
not included. In the previous study^1^ we calculated that there were on
average 1.5 men and 0.9 women who died by suicide outside the area per
year.

We used the term 'precipitating factor' to denote the main apparent
reason for suicide as it emerged in the context of the history recorded
from statements by relatives and close friends, often substantiated by a
suicide note. Data were recorded on semi-structured forms and
transferred to an SPSS database for analysis. The procedure of
extracting data from the coroner\'s records was the same for all three
periods. Data for each factor were analysed using χ^2^-tests, with a
significance level of 0.05. A logistical regression analysis
(multinominal analysis) was then completed for all factors found to be
statistically significant.

# Results {#S2}

There were 49 cases of suicide of young men during period A (population
of males aged 15--34 was 35 390)^6^ and 92 in period B (population of
males aged 15--34 was 38 314),^7^ giving an increase in the suicide rate
from to 13.85 to 24.01 per 100 000 per year of an age-adjusted
population. This was followed by a fall to 60 cases in period C
(population of males aged 15--34, 40 914),^8^ equating to a rate of
14.66 per 100 000 per year.

As can be seen in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}, there has been a
significant increase in the proportion of single men in each group, from
63% in period A to 66% in period B and 87% in period C.

## Living arrangements {#S3}

Only 27% of the men in the 1960s were living alone, rising to 38% in the
1990s and 48% in the 2000s ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). Only one
person was homeless across the first two periods and there were none in
period C. None of the men were in shared living or sheltered
accommodation in period A but there were 8 (9%) in period B and 4 (7%)
in period C.

## The role of alcohol {#S4}

There was a rise in alcohol detected at autopsy over the three periods,
from 20% to 41% to 53% ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). The number of
those classified as intoxicated also rose from 5 (10%) in period A, to
16 (17%) in period B and 15 (25%) in period C.

## Employment {#S5}

Rates of unemployment in the young men rose from 29% in the 1960s to 41%
in the 1990s to 67% in the 2000s ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}).

## Previous treatment of mental illness {#S6}

We noticed a fall in the numbers of young men who had never received
psychiatric treatment from either their general practitioner (GP) or
mental health services: from 53% in the 1960s, to 47% in the 1990s and
finally, to 23% in the 2000s ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). As
regards contact with psychiatric services, only 3 men in period A (6%)
had received treatment on an out-patient basis, compared with 14 in
period B (16%) and 13 in period C (22%). In period A, 15 young men (31%)
had at some time received in-patient treatment; this was 19 (22%) in
period B and 16 (26%) in period C. There were no cases awaiting
admission at the time of the suicide.

## Previous suicide attempts {#S7}

There was no history of a suicide attempt in 65% of cases in period A,
63% in period B and 33% in period C. Those with more than one attempt
rose from 6% to 22% and 29% in the three periods ([Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}).

## Physical health {#S8}

If the coroner\'s records identified a pre-existing medical condition, a
subjective judgement was made as to whether the effect on the individual
was mild, moderate or severe based on witness statements and medical
reports ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). This seemed to play little
role in the deaths we reviewed.

## Mode of suicide {#S9}

As seen in [Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}, the majority of people used
overdose of solids or gases as a method of suicide in period A. In
period B there had been an increase in the use of violent methods and a
change in the substances taken in overdose. There was an increase in the
role of antidepressants used as a suicide method and this continued into
period C, where the antidepressants were all selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) except in one person who took a tricyclic
antidepressant. Only in three cases could death be solely attributed to
the SSRI since other drugs were taken at the same time, a feature
reflected by an increase in 'drug combinations' in this period.

People can be counted in more than one category if a combination of
methods were used.
:::

There has also been a notable rise in 'other substances' which include
prescribed medications, over-the-counter drugs and illicit drugs. As the
numbers were significantly greater in period C than in two earlier
periods, we subsequently examined precisely which drugs were used. These
included heroin (4 cases), cocaine (5 cases), methadone (2 cases),
cannabis (2 cases), ecstasy (1 case), benzodiazepines (3 cases), codeine
(2 cases) and co-proxamol (3 cases).

## Precipitating factors {#S10}

As seen in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}, an evident precipitating
factor to suicide was present in 61% of deaths in period A, 71% in
period B and 58% in period C. These occurred with similar frequency in
the three cohorts with the exception of 'failure of a long-term
relationship', which in period A accounted for only 4 cases (8%), rising
to 20 (22%) and 13 cases (22%) in period B and C ([Table
3](#T3){ref-type="table"}). There was a drop in physical illness, court
appearance and housing issues ('domiciliary anxiety') being identified
as precipitating factors across the three periods ([Table
3](#T3){ref-type="table"}).

## Logistical regression analysis {#S11}

Multinominal logistical regression analysis was performed to establish
any adjusted association between multiple risk factors and the
likelihood of the suicide event occurring in one of the time periods. We
included the six factors found to be significantly different (*P*\<0.05)
between the three periods (being single, alcohol present at autopsy,
unemployment, having never received psychiatric treatment, previous
suicide attempt, and moderate or severe physical health problem).

Statistically significant relationships in this model to predict suicide
were being unemployed (period A to period C odds ratio (OR)=0.098,
*P*\<0.001; period B to period C OR=0.36, *P*=0.039), being single
(period A to period C OR=0.079, *P*=0.005; period B to period C
OR=0.123, *P*=0.011) and having a moderate or severe physical illness
(period A to period C OR=54.66, *P*=0.001; period B to period C=11.62,
*P*=0.031). Previous suicide attempt was only significant in the final
model for period A compared with period C and not for period B compared
with period C (OR=7.41, *P*=0.049).

# Discussion {#S12}

A striking rise and subsequent drop in the number of young men dying by
suicide has taken place in Newcastle upon Tyne over the three decades
analysed. Single young men show an increasing contribution to the total
numbers of suicides. This increase is accompanied by a rise in the
proportion living alone -- social isolation has long been recognised as
a significant factor associated with suicide.^9,10^ In spite of the
increase of divorce among young men in the population, it is notable
that they do not account for more deaths by suicide.

Previous studies have shown an association of suicide in young men with
unemployment.^11^ In 1999 Gunnell *at al*^12^ found an association
between suicide and general population unemployment rates, although they
were not able to examine by age-specific unemployment rates. We have
found an increasingly high proportion of unemployment in young men who
died by suicide, present in two-thirds by the 2000s (period C), compared
with previous studies which found rates of 39%^13^ and 36%.^14^ This is
perhaps not surprising when one considers the effect of being unemployed
at a time when young men are normally establishing their economic and
social standing in society.

The significant reduction in use of carbon monoxide and barbiturates as
a method of suicide from period A to period B coincided with the
abolition in 1972 of domestic coal gas in Newcastle and the virtual
withdrawal of barbiturates from clinical practice, emphasising the
importance of minimising the availability of methods to help reduce
suicide.^1,15^ Suicides using carbon monoxide from car exhausts remained
prevalent in the 1990s but the compulsory introduction of catalytic
converters (which reduce carbon monoxide content from car exhausts) has
strikingly reduced these fatalities by period C, as it also appears to
have happened elsewhere.^16--18^ Equally striking is the significant
rise in suicides by hanging,^19^ although Biddle *et al*^18^ observed a
decrease in hanging emerging in young men in the 21st century after a
period of steady rise previously.

It is interesting to note that the proportion and type of cases of
antidepressant misuse has increased despite the introduction of
relatively safer drugs. Not all antidepressants will have been
prescribed for depression but the assessment of suicide intent in
patients with depression and a need to prescribe safely are
important.^20^ Guidelines for depression in the UK exist to help
practitioners enquire about suicide, stating that 'not asking about
suicide in someone depressed is like not asking about allergies when
prescribing' (information available from the author on request).

Paracetamol had previously been frequently used in suicide but in
September 1998 the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain limited
the quantities which may be obtained without prescription. This
restriction has reduced suicide and liver complications due to
paracetamol overdose in the UK^15^ overall, and in Newcastle by the
2000s (period C) we noted only six cases of suicide involving
paracetamol, of which in four cases it was taken with another substance.
Indeed, an interesting feature in this study was the number of
individuals who took a variety of drugs available to them and thus
provided a combination that ensured lethality. This determination to die
is poignantly expressed in individuals who combine an unequivocal act
such as hanging with a massive drug overdose.

The relatively high incidence of jumping from heights and drowning is
likely to be related to the opportunities afforded by a number of
bridges that span the River Tyne. Strategies need to be employed to
erect preventive measures at these 'hot-spots', and indeed since 2007
there have been safety notices displayed on Newcastle\'s high bridges,
which has resulted in reduced calls to police negotiators.^21^

We have found an almost doubling of suicide associated with alcohol from
the 1960s to the last two decades we studied, present in period C in
over 40% of cases. In Lothian, Scotland, of men aged 20--29 who died by
suicide, just over a third had alcohol detected at autopsy and 26% were
above the legal limit for driving.^22^ In England and Wales, a third of
men under age 25 who died by suicide were intoxicated at the time of
death.^23^ Our study supports the importance not only of tackling
alcohol misuse as a risk factor for premature death,^24,25^ but also of
educating the population regarding the danger of alcohol in someone with
an already depressed mood.

Most precipitating factors were similar in frequency in the periods
studied, with the exemption of 'failure of a long-term relationship',
which increased over time, and it is surprising that criminal justice
involvement and housing issues have in fact decreased in frequency.

Around half the men in the first two periods and over three quarters in
period C had at some time received treatment for mental health problems.
Appleby *et al*^14^ found 76% of people aged under 35 who had died by
suicide had a psychiatric history, including 45% who were under mental
health services at the time of suicide compared with 3% of controls.^14^
Understanding why these individuals choose to die rather than utilise
services at the time of ultimate despair should be a priority for
commissioners and practitioners alike. It offers some reassurance that
we found no individuals waiting for psychiatric admission during any
period, considering the closure of many psychiatric in-patient
facilities over recent decades. It is interesting to see that the
proportion of those treated as an in-patient fell over the three periods
studied and the proportion receiving out-patient treatment increased.
This would seem to mirror the changing practice in psychiatry services
from hospital- to community-focused care. Our study did not address the
timing of their last primary care consultation. Vassilas & Morgan^26^
found consultation rates with GPs in the 4 weeks before suicide to be
significantly lower in people aged under 35 compared with those aged
over 35 (20% and 48% respectively).

Our findings show a significant increase over time in individuals with a
history of a suicide attempt; present in 67% of cases in period C, which
compares with 45%,^13^ 68%^14^ and 50%^22^ noted elsewhere, highlighting
the continued need for specialist psychosocial assessments after
self-harm.^27^

A report found that in nearly 10% of deaths by suicide (of people of all
ages) a chronic or terminal physical health condition may have been a
contributory factor.^28^ We found similar proportions of young males had
an established physical illness during the first two study periods but
only one person in period C did and the proportion of suicide in which
physical illness was identified as a precipitating factor fell. It is
difficult to explain this and echo calls for research in this area. We
have previously reported that a high percentage of people who died by
suicide in County Durham had seen their GP for low back pain in the 3
months preceding their death.^29^

## Study strengths and limitations {#S13}

Our data are derived from coroner\'s records, which is an established
and reliable method of identifying suicide cases, provided cases with an
'open verdict' are also examined and if appropriate, included in the
suicide group.^5^ The nature of our investigation did not allow us to
check psychiatric or GP records, although coroner\'s records frequently
included medical reports. Data relating to the mental or physical health
of deceased persons were thus based on coroner\'s records only and may
therefore underestimate certain variables as described earlier. A
further extension to this research may be to cross-check our data with
other available sources of medical information. In a few cases,
post-mortem alcohol levels were not available which may slightly
underestimate the number of cases where alcohol was consumed prior to
suicide.

Regrettably, we were not able to obtain age-specific data for Newcastle
upon Tyne regarding unemployment, marital status or those living alone
for all three study periods. As such, we have not been able to calculate
age-specific suicide rates for these categories.

## Key challenges {#S14}

Suicide prevention remains the raison d\'être of suicide research. Our
findings point to an approach specifically targeted at young males who,
as Keith Hawton so aptly put it, die 'by their own young hand'.^30^ The
National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England and Wales^31^ is
tackling high-risk groups but local action is required to drive forward
initiatives to reduce suicide. These need to be multifaceted and
dynamic, as our study clearly demonstrates that characteristics of young
males who die by suicide change over time. Specifically we would
recommend, based on our study findings: improvement of safety of
medication and safety measures at sites of possible suicide needs to
continue, but the lethality of hanging is a factor that cannot be as
readily influencedstrategies to reduce the association of suicide with
alcohol in young men are urgently requiredbetter understanding of the
support needed by young men going through a relationship crisismental
health services should evaluate why individuals dying by suicide are
choosing not to utilise mental health servicesother services, such as
general practice,^32,33^ police,^34^ ambulance and Social Services see
these young men in the months before suicide and require training to
help identify and modify risk; equally, services managing chronic or
terminal physical illnesses may need to consider when and how to
evaluate suicide risk.^28^

Although a number of changes seen in young males who die by suicide have
been highlighted, examination of individual case histories equally
demonstrates that suicide frequently results from a combination of
factors. Understanding the complexity and nature of interacting factors
leading to vulnerability, risk and premature death from suicide for
young men remains a challenge for researchers.
