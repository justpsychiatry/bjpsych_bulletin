  **Aims and method** To review the deaths of children and young people
  who took their own life. We conducted a retrospective analysis of
  serious incident reports from a National Health Service trust and
  reviews by the child death overview panels of the local safeguarding
  children boards.

  **Results** We identified 23 deaths, with annual rates varying
  considerably between local authorities and over time. Over half of the
  children (*n* = 13, 56%) were not known to specialist child and
  adolescent mental health services, with 11 having no contact with any
  agency at the time of their death. Hanging was the most common method
  (*n* = 20, 87%) and of these, half (*n* = 11, 55%) were low-level
  hangings.

  **Clinical implications** Training is required to improve awareness,
  recognition and the assessment of children at risk of taking their own
  life. Specialist child mental health services should directly assess
  plans or attempts at hanging and offer advice about the seriousness of
  attempting this. National data (by age) on children and young people
  who take their own life should be routinely published to inform
  clinical and preventive services.

title: Unexpected deaths of children and young people in the UK
---

In 2009, suicide was the leading cause of death in people aged 5-34
years in England and Wales.^1^ The reduction of death by suicide is an
important public health objective,^2^ although few studies have reported
rates of suicide in young people under the age of 18.^3,4^ Establishing
a profile of children who take their own life is difficult since there
is no single contemporary database. The UK national suicide database
does not include children younger than 15 and there is a 2-year delay in
reporting statistics, which hinders the identification of current
trends.^5^ The National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide
by People with Mental Illness includes children older than 10 but only
those known to child mental health services at the time of their
death.^6^ Local safeguarding children boards (LSCBs) have a statutory
responsibility to review the deaths of all children up to the age of 18
normally resident within their area.^7^ However, published data relate
to reviews completed within each calendar year rather than actual deaths
each year.^8^ For the year ending 31 March 2014 a total of 28% of
reviews were not completed within 12 months.

Establishing a contemporary profile of children who take their own life
can alert providers to current fatal trends, target vulnerable groups
and proactively inform local safeguarding training. However, in addition
to an absence of cohesive and contemporary data, establishing a
comprehensive picture is also compounded by grouping and definitional
issues. Suicide rates significantly increase during adolescence but are
currently reported within wider age bands rather than specific age
groups.^4,5^ Furthermore, child mental health services typically go up
to the age of 18 and yet the current reporting by the Office for
National Statistics is of suicides in 15- to 19-year-olds. Establishing
a comprehensive picture is further complicated by the caution in
reaching suicide verdicts in children and the increasing use of
narrative verdicts.^9,10^ Narrative verdicts summarise the nature and
circumstances of the death where intent is difficult to determine, a
factor that may be particularly relevant for young people and one that
will result in suicide rates being underreported.

Given these limitations, a recent analysis of suicide and accidental
deaths in children aged 10-19 years in England and Wales between 2001
and 2010 identified a total of 1523 deaths.^4^ Males were more likely
than females to take their own lives, with hanging being the most common
method. Rates in 15- to 19-year-old males fell over the 10-year period
but in the younger group low numbers prevented a more thorough
investigation of trends.

In view of the absence of national contemporary and comprehensive data a
local review was conducted of unexpected deaths in children and young
people under the age of 18 residing within five local authorities.

# Method {#S1}

We conducted a retrospective case analysis of unexpected deaths by
possible suicide of young people under the age of 18 during the period
from 1 April 2010 to 31 December 2013. Young people who lived within the
geographical area of a trust delivering mental health services spanning
five local or unitary authorities were included.

The National Patient Safety Agency has developed a framework for the
identification and reporting of serious incidents in the National Health
Service.^11^ Serious incident reports undertaken by the trust were
reviewed for all cases known to the child and adolescent mental health
services (CAMHS) during the review period. Each of the LCSBs responsible
for the five local or unitary authorities was contacted to request
reports on young people not known to CAMHS who took their own life.
Support was obtained from all LCSBs and information from the local child
death overview panels was reviewed. Records were systematically analysed
and demographic data, method of death, contributing and risk factors
were extracted.

# Results {#S2}

A total of 24 young people aged 10-17 were identified by the review. In
one instance the child death overview panel did not find any evidence to
suggest that the young person intended to take their own life
(overdose). This case was removed from the analysis.

:::

Rates of suicide per 100 000 population were calculated (i.e. total
number of deaths×population/100 000÷3.75 years), giving an annual rate
of 3.11 per 100 000 population aged 10-17. Assuming the same population
base for each year there was considerable variability between years
(i.e. 1.90 in 2010, 4.05 in 2011, 3.55 in 2012, 1.52 in 2013 per 100
000). Similarly, there were large differences between local authorities,
with one area having no unexpected deaths during the review, whereas
another had 9 ([Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}).

## Profile {#S5}

Of the 23 children, 10 (44%) were known to specialist child mental
health services, 2 were looked after, 6 were known to youth offending
services or the police and 6 had identified school problems. Eleven
children had no contact with health, education, social care or youth
justice services at the time of their death. Consistent with English
national trends, about two-thirds were male and aged ⩾15 ([Table
3](#T3){ref-type="table"}).

There was an increase in the number of young people who took their own
life in 2011, which is consistent with national figures.^1^ Deaths were
spread across the year with the largest number occurring in March and
July (four each). Almost half occurred on a Friday or Saturday and
during the evening/night. No deaths occurred on a Sunday or in December
or June. The majority of deaths happened at home or in the garden.

## Circumstances surrounding the death {#S6}

The most common cause of death was hanging (*n* = 20), with the
remaining deaths resulting from shooting (*n* = 2) and jumping (*n* =
1). Of those who died from hanging, in case of 11 children these were
low-level hangings (e.g. door handles, window catches), 8 were
high-level suspensions and in one case it was unclear.

Evidence of suicide notes, texts or farewell messages left on computers
were found in 10 cases and of these, 7 children had not been known to
CAMHS. There were a further two incidents (both known to CAMHS) where a
young man had previously posted threats to kill himself and a young
woman stated that she had planned her death.

It proved extremely difficult to obtain detailed information about
events that may have precipitated the death and in many instances no
immediate or clear trigger could be identified. Where it could be
identified death occurred after fairly routine everyday events such as
failing a driving test, minor family or sibling argument, discussion
about poor school grades, bad day at school. In other instances there
were less immediate but potentially important events that might have
contributed to the young person\'s decision to take their own life such
as breaking up with a girlfriend, drug use and a recent court
appearance.

## Potential risk factors {#S7}

We searched for information on a number of potential risk factors such
as previous self-harm, drug use, sexual identity, internet use, peer
relationships/bullying. Recording of this information in the documents
examined was poor.

A known history of previous self-harm was reported in 8 children of whom
5 had made previous serious suicide attempts including an overdose (*n*
= 1) and past hanging/ligature tying (*n* = 4). All children with a
known history of self-harm had been involved with CAMHS; 3 had
previously been in-patients with 6 being open cases to CAMHS at the time
of their death.

In 6 cases (5 known to CAMHS) significant alcohol and/or drug misuse was
identified. Although no sexual identity issues were identified, there
were concerns about the young person\'s sexual behaviour in 6 cases (all
known to CAMHS). These included significant past sexual abuse,
involvement in prostitution, relationship with a significantly older
partner and an extreme reaction to witnessing the sexual behaviour of a
parent.

Information about internet usage was poorly documented, although in four
more recent cases there was evidence that young people had been
researching internet sites for information about how to carry out a
suicide.

In terms of peer relationships, being the victim of current bullying was
not identified in any case. Although some young people had a limited
social circle, significant friendship issues that may have contributed
to their decision to take their own life were identified in only one
case. In this instance a young person\'s relationship ending with their
significantly older partner appears to have influenced their decision.

# Discussion {#S8}

Before discussing the implications of this review, its limitations need
to be acknowledged. First, there was considerable variability in the
quality and comprehensiveness of the reports examined. Some of the
variables we investigated may have been present but were not identified
or fully detailed in the information reviewed. Second, our sample is
small which can result in trends being under- or overinflated or skewed
by a few cases. Third, it was difficult to ascertain whether issues were
historical or current and whether they were directly related to the
young person\'s death. Fourth, this review spanned almost 4 years during
which awareness of potentially important factors such as social media
has increased. These factors may have been present in earlier cases but
may not have been investigated.

Our review demonstrates that it is challenging to gain a comprehensive
and contemporary understanding of young people who take their own life.
From a service perspective it is difficult to determine whether
variations in rates over time are indicative of a growing national
problem or reflect a worrying local trend. The local increase observed
in 2011, which led to this review, was ultimately shown to reflect a
national increase during that year. However, even within this annual
rise there was considerable variability across the five local
authorities that participated in this review.

Similarly, although numbers are small, detailing specific ages rather
than age bands has highlighted the deaths of a number of 13-year-olds.
Detailing these has facilitated useful discussions with LCSBs and
informed suicide prevention strategies and the specific age group to
target. We therefore endorse the recommendation from Windfuhr and
colleagues^4^ to routinely publish statistics on suicides in children
aged 10 and above. We would however advocate that this should be done by
specific age rather than by age band groupings since this may more
helpfully inform suicide prevention strategies.

Our review has highlighted a number of issues which merit particular
attention. First, the majority of children who took their own life were
not known to specialist CAMHS, with almost half having no contact with
any service at the time of their death. Keeping children safe is not the
responsibility of a single service or agency. Everyone who has contact
with children and young people has a role and training may be required
to improve awareness, recognition and assessment of at-risk children.
Second, hanging was by far the most common method used by children to
take their own life. Risk assessments should therefore routinely and
directly enquire about thoughts, research (e.g. internet websites),
plans or previous attempts at hanging. Specialist CAMHS should also
consider the advice they provide to young people who are considering or
have experimented with ligatures. These are high-risk behaviours and
their potential seriousness should be directly discussed with the young
person. This was strongly endorsed by a young person user group who felt
that many were not fully aware of the seriousness or speed of death that
could result from ligatures. Finally, these findings have implications
for the out-of-hours support provided by specialist CAMHS for young
people who are at risk of taking their own life. Targeting support on
Friday and Saturday evenings, the times when deaths were more likely to
occur, might be helpful.

Our review has demonstrated how difficult it is for local services to
gain contemporary information about young people who take their own
life. Reporting deaths by age and the adoption of a standardised
framework for assessing risk and contributing factors would be a useful
first step to increase our understanding.
