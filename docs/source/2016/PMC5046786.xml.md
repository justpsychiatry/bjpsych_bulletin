  **Aims and method** Recent policy guidelines published by the
  Department of Health highlight the need to develop gender-sensitive
  psychiatric services. However, very little is currently known about
  the specific characteristics and needs of female patients entering
  acute psychiatric wards, particularly psychiatric intensive care
  units. This article aims to review the current literature on what is
  known about this group of patients. PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO were
  systematically searched using a number of key terms.

  **Results** A total of 27 articles were obtained. The findings were
  divided into four categories: admission characteristics, treatment
  needs, risk management and outcomes after discharge. Gender
  differences were found in diagnosis and presentation.

  **Clinical implications** The differences observed in the reviewed
  studies suggest that women may have different assessment and treatment
  needs, and ultimately, different philosophies of care. A dearth of
  studies in this area indicates that if services are to develop in line
  with government policies, more research is needed.

title: "Women in acute psychiatric units, their characteristics and
  needs: a review"
---

Evidence suggests that mental health services have historically ignored
the needs of female patients.^1^ In the 1990s, concerns regarding the
lack of privacy and safety for women in psychiatric services led to
calls for change.^2^ According to Bartlett & Hassell,^3^ these concerns
were most evident in in-patient settings, where women were always in the
minority, security levels were inappropriately high, and equality was
not valued. These failings were investigated by the Department of
Health,^4^ which led to the publication of policy guidelines on the
provision of gender-sensitive care and women-only services.^5^ This was
driven not only by safety concerns, but also by a growing body of
evidence demonstrating gender differences within pathways into services,
treatment needs, and treatment responses.^5^ These guidelines emphasised
the development of services where women can feel safe, understood, and
where staff are skilled in responding appropriately to issues such as
violence, abuse, parenting roles, poverty and isolation.^6^

Studies have shown that single-gender wards are not necessarily safer or
more gender-sensitive.^7^ The provision of a gender-sensitive approach
requires staff attitudes to change and treatment programmes to be
tailored to the needs of the women they are treating.^3^ However,
research into what this should look like has been scarce, and there
remains no clear, single approach to issues of gender, despite the
government guidance.^8^ This is especially the case in secure and acute
settings where the difficulties faced by female patients may be more
subtle, and the hierarchical environment may feed into their feelings of
powerlessness, exacerbating their illness.^3^ There is evidence that the
needs of women in these services may have been particularly
overlooked.^9^ This is worrying, given that women with a serious mental
illness are considered to be more vulnerable to abuse and
exploitation.^10^

Psychiatric intensive care units (PICUs) were developed to treat acutely
disturbed patients whose behaviour could not be contained on general
wards.^11^ A national audit of 33 adult PICUs (the majority were
mixed-gender) found that they are not unique in the number of reports of
sexual harassment and assaults against women.^12^ National minimum
standards for PICUs^13,14^ have included such gender-related issues as
the provision of gender-specific areas, ensuring equality of all
treatments and assessment tools, ensuring self-care needs are met, and
providing gender-sensitive groups. However, implementing these
recommendations has presented practical issues, as the majority of PICU
patients are male.^15^ Furthermore, the impact of these policies on
building more gender-sensitive services has not yet been properly
evaluated.^16^ Even more concerning is that there is no clear picture in
the literature of what the specific needs of women admitted to PICU are.
This paper will therefore review the existing literature on the
characteristics and needs of women admitted to psychiatric in-patient
services, with a particular focus on women admitted to secure units and
PICUs.

# Method {#S1}

PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO were systematically searched using the
following key terms: 'PICU', 'psychiatric intensive care unit',
'secure', 'ward', 'gender', 'gender-sensitive', 'difference\*', 'women',
'female\*', 'psychiatric', 'serious mental illness', 'acute mental
disorder'. Using these terms, a manual search of the *Journal of
Psychiatric Intensive Care* was also conducted to identify further
relevant articles. Researchers from a feminist perspective have
suggested that using a variety of research methods leads to a more
holistic portrayal of the subject in question.^17^ In keeping with this
perspective, the current review included the findings from both
qualitative and quantitative studies. Specifically, studies that have
focused on investigating gender differences in adult psychiatric
in-patient services, in particular any studies that have investigated
gender differences in PICU wards. This includes studies that have
collected data from service users, staff and services in general. This
was not limited to UK studies in order to obtain a more international
picture of women\'s needs in these types of services. It is therefore
acknowledged that, although PICU is a generally well-known term, in some
countries the term emergency psychiatry may be used as a synonym for
PICU.

# Results {#S2}

The results of the database searches were manually screened and we
removed articles that did not fit the selection criteria or had
inappropriate content ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}). We found 7
articles that specifically related to PICU and 20 that concerned gender
issues in general psychiatric in-patient settings. These were based in a
variety of settings including low, medium and high secure units, general
psychiatric hospitals, acute wards and forensic psychiatric wards. The
relevant studies found in this review are listed in [Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}. The studies used both quantitative and
qualitative methods and were not limited to the UK, although all were
based in high-income Western countries. To understand the findings in
more depth, the studies were divided into four categories relating to
the different care pathways: admission characteristics, treatment needs,
risk management and outcomes after discharge. This was so that the
findings could be considered within the context of the relevant care
pathway, as each has different implications for assessment and
treatment. Within each category, findings from general and secure wards
are discussed first, followed by the findings from articles specifically
relating to PICU.

## Admission characteristics {#S3}

Within secure in-patient settings, men are consistently more likely to
be admitted than women.^18^ Women who are admitted tend to have fewer
previous convictions, more previous psychiatric admissions, and are more
likely to be admitted from hospital than prison.^18,19^ Women with a
forensic history are significantly more likely to have been charged with
or convicted of arson.^18,20,21^ Female patients are more likely to have
a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and personality disorder,
borderline personality disorder in particular,^18,19,21--24^ whereas
male patients are more likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and
to have comorbid substance misuse.^19,22^ Women are also more likely to
present with a range of other conditions, such as eating disorders and
anxiety disorders.^18^ In terms of their histories, they are more likely
to present with a history of self-harm and physical and/or sexual
abuse.^19,20^ A review of women in secure services concluded that they
represent a diverse group with individual personal, psychiatric and
forensic histories.^24^ However, the current review revealed some trends
that have implications for assessment and treatment, such as that women
are more likely to be diagnosed with a personality disorder, and to have
histories of physical and/or sexual abuse.

Female patients admitted to PICU are also consistently in the
minority.^25^ Most studies in this area have not included gender in the
analysis, which means that the findings mainly describe male PICU
patients. These studies show that the majority of PICU patients are
typically male, White, in their thirties, and have a primary diagnosis
of schizophrenia.^15,25--28^ Patients often have histories of substance
misuse, violence and aggression.^26,27,29^ Where studies have included
gender in the analysis, there is the problem of small sample sizes and
thus a lack of power. Brown *et al*\'s^27^ study had a relatively large
cohort (*n* = 332), but of these only 72 (21.5%) were female. Another
study^29^ had a smaller sample size (*n* = 206), but assessed a higher
percentage of female in-patients (*n* = 64, 31%). We can tentatively
suggest that women admitted to a PICU may be more likely to be in a
relationship, self-harm is more common but no more severe than in men,
and fewer women than men misuse drugs or alcohol.^27,29^ No gender
differences have been found in symptom severity.^26^ There was
disagreement about whether there are gender differences in primary
diagnosis within the three studies found that investigated this. Two
studies suggested that female PICU patients may be less likely to have a
primary diagnosis of schizophrenia, and more likely to be diagnosed with
personality disorder.^26,27^ The other study found no differences.^29^
One study that looked exclusively at the characteristics of female PICU
patients found that the majority were White, and had diagnoses of either
schizophrenia or personality disorder;^30^ 77% of the total sample (*n*
= 49) had histories of physical aggression and severe self-harm, and had
a number of previous admissions to mental health wards. Another study
suggested that female patients may have significantly higher rates of
violence and self-harm before their PICU admission than male PICU
patients.^26^ However, this study had a small sample size (*n* = 165)
and only 37 patients (22.5%) were female. It also used a retrospective
design and data were taken from only one unit, which significantly
limits the generalisability of these findings. Overall, these studies
suggest that women are as unwell as men on admission to a PICU, but
there may be differences in diagnosis and presentation.

## Treatment needs {#S4}

We found a limited number of studies that directly compared the
treatment needs of men and women. However, a number of qualitative
studies have conducted in-depth explorations of what women want from
services. A systematic review^31^ of male and female experiences in a
psychiatric ward found only five relevant articles. These findings
suggested that women prefer to have a broad range of treatment options,
including therapy groups, complementary therapy and writing activities.
Women also preferred being in a single-gender environment, as they felt
safer and more able to talk to other women about their experiences. Long
*et al*^32^ conducted a focus group with women (*n* = 19) who were
volunteers from medium and low secure units. Most of the patients had a
dual diagnosis of personality disorder (mainly borderline personality
disorder) and mental illness. Thematic analysis revealed five factors to
which the patients attached greatest importance: the development of good
interpersonal relationships with staff, who are understanding,
empathetic, have insight, and get to know the patients beyond their
mental illness; well-planned and meaningful activities; acknowledgment
of progress; having clear rules; and a dual emphasis on physical and
mental needs.^32^ Other important factors included an individualised
approach that promotes empowerment, a safe and settled environment with
emphasis on de-escalation, and the importance of instilling hope by
having future-oriented goals.^32^ These findings have been supported by
qualitative studies of women\'s experiences in general in-patient
psychiatric services.^33,34^ One study that compared the experiences of
men and women recovering from a severe mental illness found that women
are more likely to emphasise the need for emotional support and trusting
relationships with staff.^34^ Another study found that women on an acute
in-patient ward with an insecure attachment style had more difficulties
forming emotional and relational bonds than securely attached men and
women, as well as insecurely attached men.^35^ This suggests that having
an understanding of attachment theory^36^ and how this may influence the
therapeutic alliance may be important when working with women. A study
comparing male and female in-patients with comorbid substance use
disorder found that having family problems and being divorced was a risk
factor for women but not for men.^37^ The authors suggested that a
treatment approach focusing on distress, family problems and relational
issues may be more beneficial for women.

No studies were found that explored the treatment needs of women,
specifically within PICU. A literature review of the working model of
PICU suggests that patients generally prefer structure, routine and a
good number of activities to keep them occupied.^25^ Staff interactions
with patients were also noted as important aspects of care in PICU,
including enabling the patient to feel heard, understood and treated
with respect. O\'Brien *et al*^15^ found that women tended to receive
longer-term care than men. However, this study is limited by a small
sample size (*n* = 91), and is based in only one London trust.
Gintalaite-Bieliauskiene *et al*^30^ found that some patients with
personality disorder had excessively long in-patient stays in PICUs.
Research needs to be carried out to investigate the needs of women in
PICU to address this gap in the literature. It may also be necessary to
investigate the question of why some patients with a personality
disorder may be staying in hospital longer than is appropriate, as PICUs
are not designed for long-term care.

## Risk management {#S5}

A number of quantitative studies have analysed incidents of violence and
aggression on in-patient wards. It is generally found that female
in-patients are aggressive at similar rates and severity levels as male
in-patients, although they may be less likely to cause injury to
others.^23^ Krakowski & Czobor^38^ found that women had a much higher
level of verbal assaults and early physical assaults. Difficulties with
ward routine and social interactions were found to be more highly
associated with aggression in these women. A more recent survey of
incidents on medium and low secure units^39^ found that women were more
likely to be involved in other-directed and self-harm incidents, but
that men were involved in the most severe incidents. The higher level of
intensive observations required for women who self-harm, as well as the
smaller number of women in services, means that caring for women is
generally considered more resource intensive than for men.^40^ This may
contribute to the feeling often reported by staff that female patients
are more demanding to work with, and may help explain the higher level
of burnout and emotional exhaustion associated with working on a
female-only ward.^41^

The literature on gender differences in risk management in PICUs is
extremely scarce. One study has suggested that, compared with men, women
in PICUs present with significantly higher rates of violence towards
themselves and others during their admission; they may also be more
likely to be placed in seclusion and to be prescribed antidepressants
and mood stabilising drugs.^26^ However, this study is limited as it had
a relatively small sample size (*n* = 165), uses a retrospective design,
and is based on only one unit.

## Outcomes after discharge from in-patient services {#S6}

Gender differences have been found in outcomes at the point of discharge
for women in psychiatric in-patient settings. A study analysing Health
of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) found that on discharge,
deterioration in scores was associated with female gender.^42^ This
implies that women may not show the same improvements that men do.
Another study found that women have a significantly higher chance of
being readmitted to a psychiatric hospital than men.^19^ In contrast,
the risk of reconviction for committing a criminal offence is higher for
men.^19,43^ However, once history of self-harm, substance misuse and
previous criminal histories were adjusted for, the gender differences in
reconviction rates were reduced.^44^ There are no studies directly
relating to outcomes for female patients discharged from PICU.

# Discussion {#S7}

This review has identified a number of characteristics that women in
in-patient psychiatric settings tend to present with. First, the
evidence presented here suggests that the need for good interpersonal
relationships with staff is a central aspect of caring for women
admitted to psychiatric wards. Numerous qualitative studies have
highlighted this issue,^32--34^ and emphasise that staff should be
understanding, empathetic, insightful, and should get to know the
patient beyond their illness. This may be linked to the finding that
there is a higher co-occurrence of personality disorders and histories
of abuse or trauma in female in-patients. Therefore, developing a good
therapeutic alliance could be a crucial part of treatment for patients
who are more likely to be sensitive to feelings of abandonment and
rejection.^40^ Previous research has suggested that women are more
socially oriented than men.^45^ However, social interactions were found
to be more highly associated with aggression in females than in
males.^38^ Therefore, in order to maintain a therapeutic environment,
good interpersonal relationships with staff, who also have an awareness
of attachment difficulties, may be more valuable for women in the acute
phases of mental illness. This has been supported by studies showing
that positive perceptions of the ward environment were associated with
higher levels of therapeutic alliance.^46^

Second, this review suggests that a clear routine and structure within
the ward, as well as a full activity programme, is important in order to
maintain a safe and settled environment. This was supported in a number
of qualitative studies focusing on the experiences of women in secure
settings. This may also be equally important for men in secure settings.
However, evidence has suggested that there is a stronger link between
female aggression and ward routine.^38^ Therefore, having a clear
routine may be especially important for women in helping to reduce
violence and aggression rates. This may also link to the increased
prevalence of personality disorder in female in-patients, as studies
have suggested that a structured, goal-oriented approach, with
consistent treatment boundaries, is effective for treating personality
disorder.^47^

Third, this review suggests that women tend to present with higher rates
of comorbidity with other mental health problems (including personality
disorders, eating disorders and anxiety disorders), as well as a higher
occurrence of trauma, abuse and self-harm. Evidence suggests that these
factors are all significant predictors of poor outcomes in longitudinal
studies.^48^ The increased prevalence of personality disorder and the
fact that women are more likely to have been victims of violence in the
past have also been linked to higher rates of aggression in female
patients.^49^ This complex constellation of problems may contribute to
the finding that women tend to have longer lengths of stay at
PICUs;^15,30,50^ and may also be linked to the higher levels of burnout
reportedly experienced by staff working on female wards.^41^ Previous
researchers have made recommendations for increased relational security
due to the higher level of risk (to staff, other patients and
themselves) than that found in men.^24,51^ Relational security
emphasises more individualised levels of security, skilled nursing care
and psychological therapies. This highlights the importance of services
providing a high level of staff support and training so that they are
able to safely contain and manage these complex problems while also
providing access to appropriate therapeutic interventions.^52^
Researchers have found that providing staff with gender-informed
training can greatly improve the experience and recovery process for
patients.^53^ Therefore, the findings of this review also highlight the
need for staff training, supervision and competence in dealing with
these complex issues sensitively.

It has been argued that, despite 20 years of research in this area,
evidence that there is a clear understanding of what works for this
group remains scant.^54^ This was found to be the case in this review,
especially in terms of the number of articles available on gender
differences in PICU. Although it is possible to make some suggestions
and recommendations about women in secure or general in-patient wards
based on the current evidence base, this is not possible about women in
PICUs. This suggests that there is a lack of awareness about the
characteristics and needs of this group. For example, one of the main
findings from the present review was regarding the gender differences in
diagnosis and the higher prevalence of personality disorder in women in
secure and general in-patient wards. However, there is no strong
evidence to support this difference in PICU due to the lack of robust
studies. In the past, research findings from men in PICU have been
generalised to women, and treatment or care pathways were applied to
women in the same way as they were to men. It has also been argued that
mental health services have often failed women by ignoring the sources
of their distress, medicalising what are in fact social difficulties,
and failing to recognise their roles as mothers.^55,56^ PICUs have
struggled to address these issues, and there is evidence that this has
been due to practical problems.^15^ However, there is also the
possibility that the higher emphasis placed in PICU on medical and
behavioural management of symptoms means that a focus on the specific
needs of women can be easily lost.

Services have made progress since then, and new national minimum
standards for PICUs and low secure units^57^ have now been published.
These standards recognise that women do have different needs to men in a
number of areas including the physical environment, risk management,
assessment and staffing. However, there remains a need for the
characteristics of this population to be mapped out clearly, so that
treatment can be adapted to meet their needs.^21^ Developing services
that are tailored to meet the needs of men and women, and evaluating the
impact of these treatment programmes, are seen as a research priority by
the government.^5^ The continuation of research in this area is
therefore crucial if services are to develop gender-sensitive treatment
programmes.

# Strengths and limitations {#S8}

This review provides a fresh overview of a topic that may have been
overlooked until now. The findings can be utilised by services
interested in developing a more gender-sensitive approach. However, the
findings also highlight the fact that this group of women is not
homogenous.^24^ There may also be many similarities between male and
female patients; what is important for female in-patients may also be
important for the care of male in-patients. However, this article is
part of a wider research project aimed at addressing this issue by
gathering more evidence on what factors may be more important for women
in PICUs compared with men.

The main limitation of this review is that the ability to draw any firm
conclusions based on the current academic literature, particularly
regarding PICU, is extremely limited. Most of the articles found focus
on admission profiles of women, but are limited by small sample sizes.
This indicates a pressing need for more robust studies to be carried out
on admission characteristics, and for further research to be conducted
on outcomes and effective treatments. For example, analysing gender
differences in risk profiles and outcomes within PICU, or interviewing
staff and service users to gather their views on what women requiring
intensive psychiatric care need. Finally, this review did not include
searches for relevant policy reports, which present a resource that
could be utilised in future reviews of the needs of female in-patients.
