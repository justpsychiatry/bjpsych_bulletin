  **Aims and method** The aims of the study were to develop a scale
  sensitive enough to measure the interpersonal processes within a
  therapeutic environment, and to explore whether the new scale was
  sensitive enough to detect differences between settings, including a
  community based on compassionate mind and contextual behaviourism. The
  Therapeutic Environment Scales (TESS) were validated with 81
  participants in three different settings: a specialist service for
  anxiety disorders, a specialist in-patient ward and a psychodynamic
  therapeutic community.

  **Results** TESS was found to be reliable and valid. Significant
  differences were seen between the services on the dimensions of
  compassion, belongingness, feeling safe, positive reinforcement of
  members\' acts of courage, extinction and accommodation of unhelpful
  behaviours, inconsistency and high expressed emotion. These processes
  were over time associated with improved outcomes on a specialist
  service for anxiety disorders.

  **Clinical implications** The TESS offers a first step in exploring
  important interpersonal relationships in therapeutic environments and
  communities. An environment based on a compassionate mind and
  contextual behaviourism offers promise for the running of a
  therapeutic community.

title: Development of a compassion-focused and contextual behavioural
  environment and validation of the Therapeutic Environment Scales
  (TESS)
---

Long-term rehabilitation wards, residential units and therapeutic
communities continue to serve a wide range of populations with chronic
mental health difficulties. However, the interpersonal processes that
facilitate change within a therapeutic environment are under-researched.
A central unanswered question is how such services can enhance their
outcomes through their environment. An area of concern at our anxiety
disorders residential unit was whether we were harnessing the potential
of the community to enhance outcomes. Therefore, we focused on the
quality and style of relationships within the community to optimise the
therapeutic environment. This makes sense, especially given the power of
affiliative relationships to change a whole range of processes including
physiological processes.^1-3^

We developed a model that builds on attachment theory of group
psychodynamic therapeutic communities.^4^ The model consisted of an
evolutionary and compassion-focused approach,^5^ which incorporates the
principles of learning theory and functional analytical
psychotherapy.^6^ In brief, the environment created is one that
incorporates compassion (a sensitivity to the suffering of others and a
deep commitment to relieve and prevent that suffering), connectedness to
other members and regulation of potentially damaging high expressed
emotion or punishment by shaming. The term 'members' refers to both
residents/patients and staff in a community. Four aspects are therefore
facilitated: being genuinely and authentically compassionate to one
anotherbeing open and trusting of compassion from othersdeveloping
self-compassion rooted in deepening self-awareness and empathic
commitment to try to help oneselfmembers (staff and residents) are
encouraged to be aware of each other\'s problems and acts of courage and
respond with natural reinforcement to create a safe, collaborative and
supportive environment for all. No relevant scale exists for measuring
such an environment. Therefore, the first aim of the current study was
to develop a scale that measures the interpersonal processes of such an
environment. The second aim was to explore whether the new scale was
sensitive enough to detect differences between settings. This is a
report on the first attempt at setting up a community with a
compassion-focused and contextual behavioural environment. It was
hypothesised that such an environment would demonstrate significant
differences between a specialist anxiety disorders unit, a group
psychodynamic therapeutic community and an in-patient ward, and that the
change in the milieu on the anxiety disorders unit would be associated
over time with an improved outcome.

# Method {#S1}

The study had several stages. First, the new self-report scale to
measure people\'s experiences of core interpersonal domains and
processes in a therapeutic environment was validated. The use of the
scale was then explored in three different settings in a group cohort
design. The main outcome measure for the treatment of
obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD) was also compared before and after
developing the new environment at a specialist anxiety disorders
service.^4^ Ethical approval for the study was gained from Harrow
Research Ethics Committee in London (reference: 11/LO/1418).

## Participants {#S2}

Participants were recruited from three adult mental health settings
([Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). The first was the anxiety disorders
residential unit (ADRU) at Bethlem Royal Hospital. ADRU is a national
specialist service providing intensive cognitive--behavioural therapy
(CBT) for people with severe treatment-refractory anxiety disorders. The
service has 16 beds and is only staffed during the daytime. The average
stay is 12 weeks. Forty-two participants, mainly with severe OCD, were
recruited.

ADRU, anxiety disorders residential unit; OCD, obsessive--compulsive
disorder.
:::

The second setting was a specialist in-patient unit, a national
specialist service for affective and personality disorders. It had 18
beds and the average stay was 6 months. Fourteen participants with
either recurrent depression or personality disorder were recruited. The
unit was unexpectedly closed for financial reasons during the study,
which limited the numbers recruited.

The third setting was a traditional psychodynamic therapeutic community.
Members attend at least 3 days a week and there is an average of 25
members attending over a 2-year programme. Twenty-five participants,
mainly with borderline personality disorder, were recruited.

## Measures {#S3}

### Therapeutic Environment Scales (TESS) {#S4}

The TESS was developed with the aim of measuring the occurrence of
various interpersonal processes in the therapeutic environment. It is
theoretically driven, with nine subscales of interpersonal behaviour
that may influence the environment. These domains were chosen after a
review of the literature as having the most evidence for promotion of
safeness and courage to change one\'s behaviour.^4^ The subscales
include: positive reinforcement by others at the time of an act of
courage (which is defined as difficult or anxiety-provoking and is
related to the person\'s goals)extinction of their own unhelpful
behaviours (e.g. self-harming, ritualising) depending on the response of
otherscommunication with honesty, openness and genuinenessfeeling safe
with others to express needs or to try out new behavioursbelongingness
and shared purpose with a responsibility to otherscompassion (defined as
being sensitive to distress in others with a deep commitment to try to
relieve it). There are three negative subscales: 7inconsistency in
responses by others8accommodation of unhelpful behaviours and taking
over responsibility by others9high expressed emotion by others. The TESS
has three main sections: part 1 examines the respondent\'s experience
with staff, part 2 asks about their experience with non-staff members
(other residents or patients), and part 3 assesses processes that do not
relate to interactions within the community but rather to the
individual\'s own behaviour (goal-setting and tasks, participating in
structured activity, democracy and ability to influence the environment,
keeping to and questioning boundaries). Responses on all items are given
on a 7-point Likert scale (1 'strongly disagree' to 7 'strongly agree').
Negative items are reverse-scored. A mean score is then generated for
each subscale. All items refer specifically to the past week. Items were
generated by consideration of the theoretical model. The questionnaire
and scoring details may be downloaded from the online data supplement to
this paper.

### The Essen Climate Evaluation Schema (EssenCES) {#S5}

The EssenCES^7^ was originally validated for assessing the social and
therapeutic atmosphere of a forensic psychiatric unit. It is a
self-report scale composed of three five-item subscales: 'Experienced
safety (*v.* threat of violence)', 'Patients' cohesion and mutual
support' (measuring peer support) and 'Therapeutic hold and support'
(relationship with staff). The range for the total score is 0 to 60.

### The Good Milieu Index (GMI) {#S6}

The GMI^8^ is a five-item self-report scale validated for measuring
general satisfaction with aspects of the therapeutic milieu: the
setting, the staff, the other patients, the programme and their
improvement. The items give a total score ranging from 5 to 25. Higher
scores reflect higher satisfaction.

### The Yale--Brown Obsessive--Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) {#S7}

The Y-BOCS^9^ is a ten-item clinician-rated scale that measures severity
of obsessive and compulsive symptoms. A total score for the measure
ranges from 0 to 40. Higher scores denote greater symptomatology.

## Procedure {#S8}

### Creating a compassion-focused and contextual behavioural environment {#S9}

During the research period, staff at ADRU attended advanced training
workshops in compassion-focused therapy and functional analytical
psychotherapy on the unit. The emphasis was on helping members to gain a
psychological understanding of one another\'s behaviour within an
evolutionary and developmental formulation. Members were encouraged to
look out for acts of courage and efforts towards change. Residents
shared their goals with others in community meetings (e.g. a behavioural
experiment or exposure task that had been agreed) and on a daily message
board. The aim was for members to respond naturally with compassion as
soon as they noticed a resident\'s acts of courage and efforts at
improvement ('positive reinforcement'). This approach was coupled with a
compassionate mind and tolerance of unhelpful behaviours that affected
fellow residents ('extinction'). Residents were taught self- and
other-compassion in weekly groups delivered by staff with relevant
imagery exercises and mindfulness. They were taught to communicate with
one another in an honest and compassionate manner without being
judgemental or critical, and without accommodating each other\'s
problems. All members were encouraged to support each resident to follow
their valued directions with structured activity and tasks that
supported their goals. As in a traditional therapeutic community,
residents were given more responsibility to run it. They had
self-allocated roles, including looking after communal areas, dealing
with porters, cleaners and caterers directly, and helping recruit new
staff.

### Administering the TESS {#S10}

Participants within each setting were asked for consent before
completing the questionnaires. They were offered the choice of
completing the TESS again 3 days after the initial completion. All
participants who completed the questionnaires were given a high street
shopping voucher to thank them for their time on the project.

### Statistical analysis {#S11}

Comparisons of demographic characteristics for all 81 participants were
conducted using Chi-square comparisons, Kruskal-Wallis comparisons and
*post hoc* Mann--Whitney *U*-tests. Mixed analysis of variance was
applied to compare Y-BOCS outcome scores of residents at ADRU before the
new environment was introduced with outcomes after the change. TESS
subscale scores were compared across the three settings using
Kruskal-Wallis tests and *post hoc* Mann--Whitney *U*-tests. All
preliminary inferential analyses had a significance value of α = 0.05
and *post hoc* tests used the Bonferroni adjusted significance value of
α = 0.017.

Internal consistency of the TESS was examined by calculating Cronbach\'s
alpha (α) for each of the subscales. Subscales whose Cronbach\'s α value
could be rounded up to 0.70 or more are generally considered to have
acceptable internal consistency.^8,10^ Items were deleted from subscales
where their removal caused an increase in Cronbach\'s alpha to 0.70 or
more. Test-retest reliability of the total scale was analysed on 15
participants who completed the TESS twice. Spearman\'s rho correlations
were conducted to determine the association between scores from the two
administrations, occurring 3 days apart. A 3-day hiatus period was
chosen as this was short enough to minimise chances of genuine changes
in the environment, but long enough to avoid recall effects. Convergent
validity of the TESS was measured using Spearman\'s rho correlations
between each subscale with outcome measures of therapeutic environments.
Average rankings of TESS scores for relationships with staff and other
non-staff members were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test
comparisons for each setting.

# Results {#S12}

## Demographic characteristics {#S13}

[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} shows demographic baseline
characteristics of participants. At both the in-patient unit and the
therapeutic community, significantly higher proportions of participants
were females. There were no significant differences between the mean
ages of participants. As expected, there were significant differences in
the main diagnoses and lengths of residents\' stays across the settings.

## Internal consistency of the TESS {#S14}

The Cronbach\'s alpha for the TESS subscales ranged from 0.68 to 0.92,
indicating that 20 out of 22 of the subscales had acceptable internal
reliability (Table DS1 in Online data supplement). One subscale
('Activity') had a Cronbach\'s α of 0.63 and was considered acceptable
as there are only four items. One subscale ('Boundaries', α = 0.57) was
not improved by deleting one item and was therefore removed from further
analysis.

## Test re-test reliability {#S15}

Repeat reliability of the TESS was analysed based on a subgroup of 15
participants completing the scale twice (Table DS2). The TESS scores
showed good stability over the 3-day interval. All but 2 of the 22
subscales were correlated to a significant level and Spearman\'s rho
values ranged from r~s~ = 0.54, *P*\<0.05 to r~s~ = 0.95, *P*\<0.01. The
'Inconsistency in behaviour' subscales from part 2 of the TESS and 'High
expressed emotion' from part 1 were not significantly correlated over
time.

## Convergent validity {#S16}

The positive reinforcement, extinction, communication, safety,
belongingness and compassion TESS subscales were all significantly
positively correlated with the GMI and EssenCES total, whether it was
for staff or non-staff members (Table DS3). Inconsistency, accommodation
and emotional expression were significantly negatively correlated with
GMI and EssenCES scores for staff. The high expressed emotion was the
only subscale that negatively correlated with the GMI and EssenCES total
in non-staff members.

## Comparison on Good Milieu Index {#S17}

ADRU was rated as scoring significantly higher on the Good Milieu Index
than either the in-patient unit or the therapeutic community ([Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). The GMI scores showed that there were no
differences between the therapeutic community and the in-patient ward.

## Comparison on EssenCES {#S18}

ADRU residents rated the total EssenCES scores as higher than both the
therapeutic community and in-patient ward ([Table
1](#T1){ref-type="table"}). They rated the subscales of patient
cohesion, experienced safety and therapeutic hold as significantly
higher than the therapeutic community did. The in-patients also rated
their patient cohesion and safety as significantly higher than the
therapeutic community members did.

## Comparison between staff and non-staff members\' experiences within a setting {#S19}

At ADRU staff members were scored significantly higher than non-staff
members for positive reinforcement, extinction, communication, honesty,
genuineness, safety and compassion (Table DS7, Fig. DS1). Conversely,
staff at ADRU were scored significantly lower for inconsistency,
accommodation and high expressed emotion than non-staff members.

Staff scored significantly higher than non-staff members only for
extinction and safety at the therapeutic community (Table DS8, Fig.
DS2), and higher for inconsistency at the in-patient unit (Table DS9,
Fig. DS3). Conversely, staff at the therapeutic community and in-patient
units were scored significantly lower for high expressed emotion than
were non-staff members. All other subscales measured at both the
in-patient unit and therapeutic community did not differ significantly
between staff and non-staff.

## Comparison of relationships with staff (TESS part 1) across settings {#S20}

There were significant differences between the settings for all of the
relationships with staff scores ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}, Table
DS4). The ADRU scored significantly higher than both the in-patient unit
and therapeutic community for positive reinforcement, extinction,
safety, belongingness and compassion. ADRU also scored significantly
higher than the in-patient unit for communication. ADRU scored
significantly lower for measures of accommodation, inconsistency and
emotional expression than the therapeutic community, and significantly
lower for accommodation and emotional expression than the in-patient
unit. There were no significant differences between the in-patient and
therapeutic community scores for part 1 of the TESS.

## Comparison of relationships with non-staff members (TESS part 2) across settings {#S21}

All the subscales on the relationship with non-staff members differed
significantly across the three settings ([Fig. 2](#F2){ref-type="fig"},
Table DS5). Specifically, ADRU had significantly higher ratings than
both the in-patient unit and therapeutic community for positive
reinforcement, extinction, safety, belongingness and compassion. ADRU
scored significantly higher for communication than the therapeutic
community but not the in-patient unit. ADRU had significantly lower
ratings for accommodation, inconsistency and emotional expression than
both the in-patient unit and therapeutic community. There was no
difference between the scores on the in-patient unit and therapeutic
community on any of the subscales.

## Comparison of own behaviours scales (TESS part 3) across settings {#S22}

ADRU residents reported significantly higher scores for goals and tasks
and democracy than both in-patient and therapeutic community settings.
There were no differences between the in-patient unit and therapeutic
community ([Fig. 3](#F3){ref-type="fig"}, Table DS6).

## Comparison of ADRU outcomes between 2001--2010 and 2011--2012 {#S23}

After developing a new culture within ADRU, the Y-BOCS outcomes in
patients with OCD were significantly improved over time ([Fig.
4](#F4){ref-type="fig"}). In the period 2001--2010, residents\' mean
Y-BOCS score was 30.4 (s.d.=6.32) at the start of treatment and 20.1
(s.d.=7.52) at the end, whereas during the period of change in
2011--2012, residents\' scores were higher at the start of treatment
(mean 32.00, s.d.=4.94) and lower by the end (mean 17.06, s.d.=7.60;
*F*~(418)~=307.90, *P*\<0.001).

# Discussion {#S24}

The TESS was found to be a valid and reliable scale to 'take the
temperature' of a therapeutic environment. The subscales were found to
have reasonable internal consistency, test-rest reliability and
convergent validity. Two subscales of inconsistency and emotional
expression subscales had lower test re-test reliability. However, to
some extent this is less concerning, as emotional expression and
inconsistency are interpersonal processes that one might expect to
fluctuate from day to day more than others such as focus on goals. It is
recommended that the scales be only administered to all members on the
same day. The 'Boundaries' subscales were less reliable internally and
will require improvement from the current version of the TESS. Of note
is that all the subscales were significantly correlated with a good
therapeutic milieu except for the subscales of inconsistency,
accommodation and high emotional expression which were significantly
negatively correlated.

We analysed differences on the TESS within a setting and found that at
ADRU, the staff were rated significantly better than non-staff members
on all of the subscales. This should be expected as staff receive a
higher level of training and experience in the model and are permanent,
as opposed to residents who stay for 12 weeks and have both a lower
level of training and a primary focus on overcoming their OCD. At the
psychodynamic therapeutic community the staff were rated as
significantly better than non-staff members for only two subscales
(safety and extinction). On the in-patient unit, staff were rated higher
on the 'High expressed emotion' subscale and lower on the
'Inconsistency' subscale (i.e. staff were rated as more inconsistent
than non-staff members). This sort of finding would be important for
staff in the unit to resolve as it suggests staff conflicts and a lack
of feeling safe among members.

We then explored the use of the TESS by comparing different settings. We
found that the environment at ADRU scored significantly higher than at
the in-patient ward and a group psychodynamic therapeutic community.
Members at ADRU agreed more strongly than did the therapeutic community
or in-patient unit members that other members were more likely to treat
them compassionately, provide them with a sense of belonging and
positively reinforce their acts of courage. They felt more supported and
safe, which in theory should increase the likelihood that they undertake
the necessary behavioural experiments and exposure tasks for improving
outcomes. We therefore explored whether outcomes at ADRU improved during
the intervention outcomes and found that improved outcomes at ADRU were
associated with the period of the intervention.

There are of course limitations to the findings of differences between
the settings and improved outcomes. The differences between therapeutic
environments are likely to reflect the populations served (e.g. a person
with borderline personality disorder may rate their experience of
compassion and positive reinforcement by others in a different way to
those with an anxiety disorder). Unless one population with the same
problem or diagnosis were randomly allocated to different therapeutic
environments, we would be unable to conclude that any variations found
arose from the different environments. Furthermore, the measure used is
based on self-report rather than a behavioural measure by an independent
observer. It was also not possible to demonstrate that the changes in
ADRU\'s environment on the TESS led to improved outcomes on the Y-BOCS
for OCD. Other factors such as a change in population admitted or other
interventions may have contributed to improving outcomes at the unit.
However, if the TESS did not find differences between settings or was
not associated with better outcomes then one would question the impact
of the intervention. The next step would be to determine whether the
TESS could moderate an outcome measure after introducing a
compassion-focused and contextual behavioural environment in a better
designed and controlled study.

## Clinical implications {#S25}

The implications of our study are that it is possible for a service to
measure the interpersonal processes within a therapeutic environment.
The scale could act as a measure to 'take the temperature' of a
therapeutic environment. It may also be used as a potential research
tool to determine which interpersonal processes of a community may
moderate outcomes.

The TESS can be used freely, and routine monitoring enables staff and
non-staff members to identify problems or strengths in a community and
guide service changes. Thus, a service might first measure the
parameters of its environment at least three times to determine a
baseline before introducing changes. Some environments may wish to use
part 1 (relationships with staff) only to reduce the length of the
scale.

With further development, the scale may be applicable to adolescent and
forensic settings or a 'psychologically informed environment' (PIE),
which is defined as an environment that brings a psychological approach
to contexts that may otherwise lack the resources or expertise to run as
a formal therapeutic community.^11^

Even if a therapeutic environment in a residential setting is optimised,
some residents may then return to an environment of significant
criticism, high expressed emotion and accommodation by family members.
We are aware of the importance of ensuring that relatives feel involved
and valued. In this regard the TESS could be adapted to measuring the
family environment. Wherever possible, ADRU staff make home visits and
help carers to understand the context of their home environment; if they
can, they intervene to develop compassionate responses and a stable and
diverse range of natural reinforcers.

Further research is required into the interpersonal processes that
promote safeness, connectedness and acts of courage, and whether a
service can transform its environment and improve outcomes. For example,
a compassion-focused environment recognises that many members are
fearful of compassion and react defensively, so working with the fears
and avoidance of compassion is a main focus. Second, those with poor
empathy or mentalising skills may need to work on them before they can
offer compassion to others and feel any genuine interest from others.
Third, the environment builds distress tolerance by creating conditions
for members to feel the emotion of self-compassion that they try to
avoid. Once the model has been refined, we need randomised controlled
trials that compare a compassion-focused and contextual behavioural
environment with a group psychodynamic therapeutic community for a
specific population. In addition, we require research to explore whether
training staff in compassion and contextual behavioural models improves
not only the environment but also the outcomes. Future research could
combine qualitative with quantitative research and offer a
before-and-after intervention to transform a service.
