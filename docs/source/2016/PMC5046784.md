  **Aims and method** To investigate the burden of medical comorbidity
  in a population receiving in-patient treatment for drug and alcohol
  problems. All patients admitted over a 6-month period were included in
  the data-set. We recorded diagnostic information on admission that
  allowed the calculation of predicted 10-year survival using a
  previously validated comorbidity index.

  **Results** Despite the majority of the sample having a predicted
  10-year survival chance of greater than 75%, a sizeable minority
  (16.7%) are carrying a high burden of medical comorbidity, with a
  predicted 10-year survival chance of less than 50%. More than half
  (55.2%) of these patients were under the age of 55. Chronic
  respiratory disease was the most frequent diagnosis.

  **Clinical implications** In-patient substance misuse units serve a
  complicated group of patients, whose needs are met by active medical
  input, resident medical cover and effective liaison with general
  hospitals. This is important when planning and commissioning treatment
  services. The high burden of respiratory disease suggests the utility
  of robust smoking cessation interventions among this population.

title: Medical comorbidity and projected survival in patients admitted
  to a specialist addictions in-patient unit
---

It is well established that there is a wide range of social,
psychological and physical harms associated with chronic substance
misuse.^1^ It is also clear that, for people with mental illness,
substance misuse is an independent risk factor for physical illness.^2^
Specialist drug and alcohol treatment providers located within
psychiatric services are uniquely placed to deal with this complex
population, and require the resources and skills to effectively
diagnose, monitor and offer interventions for significant physical
frailty. In an environment where healthcare is increasingly being
provided in a community-based setting, it is important that the utility
of an in-patient unit is well defined.

This study aims to characterise the burden of medical comorbidity in
patients admitted to an in-patient drug and alcohol treatment service
within a large psychiatric hospital. These population data are
invaluable to the process of planning and commissioning services. We
also hope that the data will help to identify targets for intervention
beyond what is offered for the primary problem of substance misuse.

We are not aware of other attempts to measure the burden of comorbid
medical illness in a heterogeneous population of patients with substance
misuse.

# Method {#S1}

We conducted the present study as a prospective survey. We did not seek
to demonstrate the efficacy of interventions, but rather to explore the
population\'s characteristics.

Measurement of comorbidity is broadly divided into simple counts of
disease or prescribed medications, and validated measures that apply
weighting to a specific subset of conditions based on their contribution
to morbidity, mortality or resource utilisation. A comorbidity index
serves to distil significant complexity down to a single score to allow
comparison with other patients.^3^

We used the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), a cumulative disease
burden index, as it has the advantage of being short and easily applied
based on the information already obtained as part of a standard medical
admission. The CCI was originally developed using a cohort of 559
medical patients, and was intended to estimate the likelihood that a
clinical population would survive to benefit from a given intervention
by providing a relative risk of dying.^4^ Its validity as a combined
age--comorbidity index was studied using an additional cohort of 226
surgical patients.^5^ The index records 16 diagnoses that have
predictive value when calculating projected survival. The central role
that age plays in predicted survival is reflected in the addition of an
age-based score to the raw CCI.

We used an extended version of the CCI that includes four additional
items that predict healthcare cost, but are excluded from the
calculation of predicted 10-year survival. It was further validated
using health data for 5861 patients.^6^ We chose to use this version for
the additional breadth of common conditions captured, namely
hypertension, skin ulcers or recurrent cellulitis, treatment with
warfarin and the presence of depression.

The CCI has been used across a broad range of clinical settings and
populations, and is considered valid and reliable for estimating the
burden of medical comorbidity in clinical research.^7^ It has been shown
to predict use of in-patient and out-patient services, length of
admission to hospital and hospital care costs.^8^ Its ultimate output is
a predicted probability of survival at 10 years from data collection.

Ethics approval was not required. Approval to carry out the study was
granted by the local quality improvement team.

## Participants {#S2}

Participants included all those admitted over a 6-month period (26 May
to 27 November 2014) to a specialist in-patient assessment and
detoxification unit in a large psychiatric hospital in a major Scottish
city. The unit provides assessment, medical detoxification and
stabilisation for patients dependent on alcohol, opioids and, less
commonly, other substances including benzodiazepines, stimulants and
novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Patients who are admitted are
unsuitable for community-based treatment owing to a combination of
medical, psychiatric or social complexities. Referrals to the unit come
from community substance misuse teams operating within the local
National Health Service (NHS) health board, a catchment population of
over 800 000 covering Edinburgh and the Lothians, the second-largest
residential population in Scotland.

The population referred for in-patient management of substance misuse is
a subset of the much larger population routinely treated in
community-based services. As a group, it presents particular challenges,
whether it be due to the degree of dependence, dependence on multiple
substances, lack of social supports, chaotic social circumstances,
history of physical complications occurring during treatment or physical
frailty. The sample we present is not therefore representative of the
full range of people seeking treatment within substance misuse services.

In total, data for 175 admissions were collected.

## Data collection {#S3}

All patients admitted for in-patient management receive a medical
clerking as part of routine practice. This includes a full psychiatric
history, substance misuse history, medical history, physical examination
and appropriate investigations. A subset of these routinely collected
data was used in the present study.

A brief, paper recording tool was created for inclusion in the
admission. The full range of usual data sources were used to complete
the tool (patient report, electronic patient record, previous discharge
and out-patient letters, and general-practitioner clinical summaries).
Each item of the CCI included a brief explanation with diagnosis
boundaries where appropriate, and a tick box was used to indicate the
presence of the condition. In addition to the CCI items, the reason for
admission, substance misuse diagnoses, any other psychiatric diagnoses,
medication count and presence or absence of chronic pain were also
recorded. These additional items provided basic background data that
were not easy to obtain from the patient electronic recording system. It
was important that the data collection process did not add to the
workload of admitting doctors, nor change existing clinical practice.

Diagnoses, whether medical or psychiatric, were not independently
validated using diagnostic tests or instruments, but were discussed on a
daily basis at the ward meeting with the consultant psychiatrist and the
multidisciplinary team.

# Results {#S4}

In total, 175 patients were admitted during the 6-month period of data
collection. The demographic profile, purpose of admission, substance
misuse diagnosis and the presence of a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis or
chronic pain are summarised in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}.

The most common reason for admission was alcohol detoxification, either
as a standalone intervention or, for a small number of patients (*n* =
5, 2.9%), in combination with another intervention, such as cognitive
assessment or concurrent opiate detoxification. The next largest group
of patients were those admitted for conversion from methadone to
buprenorphine. Fewer patients (*n* = 7, 4%) were admitted for
benzodiazepine detoxification, detoxification from NPS or respite. Of
the 31 patients with a diagnosis of benzodiazepine dependence, 20
(64.5%) also had a diagnosis of alcohol dependence; 26 patients (14.9%)
had diagnoses of both alcohol and opioid dependence. Polysubstance
misuse, here defined as being dependent on three or more substances, was
present in 14 (8%) patients. There was no statistically significant
association between either alcohol dependence or opioid dependence and
chronic pain.

Two-thirds of patients (*n* = 107, 61.1%) had a psychiatric diagnosis in
addition to their substance misuse diagnosis. The range of psychiatric
diagnoses encountered is summarised in [Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}.
Of these, the most frequent diagnosis was depression, present in 83
patients. Cognitive impairment was recorded for 10 (5.7%) patients, all
of whom had alcohol dependence. A diagnosis of personality disorder was
made in 11 (6.3%) patients. There was some comorbidity of psychiatric
disorders, with 12 (6.9%) patients having two or more recorded.

:::

Relatively coarse diagnostic categories have been used because of the
nature of the patient population and the background information
available to clinicians at the time of admission. For example, a number
of patients reported or had a recorded history of psychotic symptoms. It
is difficult to retrospectively attribute these reports to substance
misuse, situational distress or other aetiologies. Similarly, although
admission documentation identified a variety of anxiety disorders, these
have not been sub-categorised because of a lack of discriminating
detail.

The proportion of patients with each of the CCI items is summarised in
[Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type="fig"}. The most common medical condition
recorded was chronic respiratory disease, present in 46 (26.3%)
patients, followed by 36 (20.6%) patients with gastric ulceration and 34
(19.4%) with chronic mild liver disease. Cardiovascular illnesses were
also represented in the sample, with 21 (12%) patients who had
hypertension, 9 (5.1%) patients who had experienced a previous
myocardial infarction and 8 (4.6%) who experienced either a
cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack. There were no
patients in the sample diagnosed with HIV. Although we have categorised
cognitive impairment as a psychiatric diagnosis in the present study, it
is also included as a weighted item in the CCI, contributing to overall
mortality.

[Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"} presents the distribution of CCI scores
and associated 10-year mortality. The majority of patients had a
predicted 10-year survival chance of greater than 75%. However, of the
29 (16.6%) patients with a less than 50% chance of survival at 10 years,
a large number (55.2%) were aged 55 or less, and two were aged 45 or
less. One patient aged between 36 and 45 had a predicted survival chance
at 10 years of less than 20%. The breakdown of ages compared with
predicted 10-year survival chance is illustrated in [Fig.
2](#F2){ref-type="fig"}. There were 41 patients (23.4%) with a CCI of 4
or more, of whom 31 (17.7%) gained either two or fewer points due to
age, thus suggesting multiple sources of physical comorbidity in these
patients.

# Discussion {#S5}

The in-patient treatment unit is based in a large psychiatric hospital
that is currently being redeveloped, and there has been considerable
discussion regarding the future location of the unit, including the
level of medical care required. Our research objectives emerged from
informal discussions among medical and nursing staff, reflecting on an
anecdotal impression that the in-patient unit was treating patients with
ever-increasing medical complexity. It is not uncommon for patients to
be transferred directly to a general hospital at the point of admission,
or shortly afterwards, owing to the severity of their physical
condition. The data presented here support this impression.

The unit has based its admission criteria on a since-withdrawn guideline
from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) -- guideline
no. 74.^9^ It outlines the patient characteristics that are likely to
make community detoxification suitable and, conversely, situations where
in-patient detoxification would be prudent. Acute physical or
psychiatric illness, undernourishment and the presence of confusion or
hallucinations all feature in the list of characteristics that indicate
in-patient detoxification. These selection criteria can be expected to
skew the medical comorbidity of the population being studied.
Quantifying this degree of comorbidity remains valuable for the planning
of care, interventions and service structure.

Despite the majority of the sample having a predicted 10-year survival
chance of greater than 75%, a sizeable minority are carrying a high
burden of medical comorbidity. The number of patients of younger age
present in this group is of particular concern. Our data show that for
patients aged between 45 and 55, the mean predicted 10-year survival
chance is 68.6%. By way of comparison, the predicted 10-year survival
chance for a 45-year-old Scottish man, based on 2011--2013 data
published by the Office for National Statistics, is 96.6%. This falls to
91.9% at age 55 and to 80.6% at age 65.^10^

Previous work has shown the extent to which mental illness shortens life
expectancy. A study conducted in a London sample showed that having a
psychiatric diagnosis resulted in 8.0 to 14.6 life years being lost for
men and 9.8 to 17.5 life years being lost for women.^11^ That study
included people with 'serious mental illness' (schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder) as well as those with a
substance use disorder and depressive episode/disorder. The predictive
tool used in our study does not allow for direct comparison, but it does
highlight a similar impact on mortality.

Harmful use of alcohol is classically associated with gastrointestinal
disease, cardiovascular disease and neurological damage. However, the
most common physical illness recorded in this patient group was chronic
respiratory disease. Most (78.9%) of the sample were current smokers at
the time of admission. Smoking status was not included in the initial
data collection tool and was recorded from retrospective review of
electronic patient records and paper case notes where needed; we were
unable to determine smoking status for one patient. In our sample, 49
(35.5%) of those who smoked were referred to the hospital smoking
cessation nurse for assessment and possible intervention. There is some
evidence that providing concurrent smoking cessation treatment during
both out- and in-patient alcohol detoxification may be more beneficial
than delaying it.^12,13^ With the recent smoking ban on the grounds of
Scottish hospitals,^14^ this may merit more robust intervention in this
population.

There is an established association between opioid dependence and
infection with blood-borne viruses.^15^ Despite the significant number
of patients with opioid dependence, the data presented here showed no
patients who were diagnosed with HIV, which may reflect the success of
opioid-replacement programmes. Of the 44 patients with liver disease, 10
(22.7%) had a diagnosis of opioid dependence, but only one of these did
not have comorbid alcohol dependence. Screening for blood-borne viruses
is, however, routinely offered to all patients admitted, given that
hepatitis C remains an important and potentially treatable cause of
cirrhosis and liver cancer, along with alcohol and metabolic syndrome
due to obesity.^16^

The high number of patients seen here with chronic pain is consistent
with previously published research.^17^ There is evidence that physical
pain may predict lapse to heavy drinking, both before and after
treatment,^18^ which may merit further investigation in this high-risk
population.

Common to all systems of comorbidity scoring, the CCI provides a single
number that is useful for patient-to-patient or group comparisons. In
this case, the number is used to calculate a probability of survival at
10 years. Although this may be useful in demonstrating the stark nature
of health outcomes in the present study population, it does not provide
a sensitive measure of predicted quality of life or functional
impairment.

## Limitations {#S6}

This study was conducted within a single in-patient service and did not
seek to modify routine clinical practice. Although based on a small
sample size, the results are likely to be generalisable to similar
in-patient units that use the criteria set out in SIGN guideline no. 74
to select the population for treatment.

Five doctors completed data collection forms, but the majority were
completed by a study author (D.M.) who was employed as a psychiatric
trainee on the unit for 4 months of the study period. There is the
possibility here of observer bias, although all patients were discussed
daily at the ward meeting with the consultant psychiatrist responsible
for the unit. The same consultant verified substance misuse and
psychiatric diagnoses. The population data presented show association
rather than cause and effect. Other factors that have an impact on life
expectancy, for example social deprivation or smoking status, were not
recorded during data collection or controlled for in the data analysis.

## Implications {#S7}

We showed that individuals receiving in-patient treatment for substance
misuse carry a high burden of physical illness. This has implications
for how services are delivered. While a general medical setting is
equipped to provide limited, usually opportunistic, detoxification for
patients with a high burden of physical comorbidity, it is not usually
able to offer planned, evidence-based treatment for patients with a
range of substance misuse disorders. In planning and providing for
substance misuse treatment services, our data suggest that in-patient
units with active medical input, resident medical cover and effective
liaison with general medical hospitals continue to address a significant
need. The ability to offer safe and effective treatment relies on
ongoing training and adequate medical resources and equipment. The
in-patient unit presented here provides physical health awareness groups
on a weekly basis, but our data suggest that a more intensive approach
may be appropriate. In particular, the very high rates of smoking and
respiratory illness represent an area of potential intervention beyond
that already offered within the hospital.

Given the significant overlap of physical and substance misuse
diagnoses, we support ongoing efforts to raise awareness among
psychiatrists of their patients\' physical health needs. Similarly, we
argue for ongoing efforts to provide substance misuse assessment and
treatment skills to physicians.
