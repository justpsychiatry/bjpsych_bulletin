  **Aims and method** This study explores the economic cost and carbon
  footprint associated with current patterns of prescribing long-term
  flupentixol decanoate long-acting injections. We conducted an analysis
  of prescription data from a mental health trust followed by economic
  and carbon cost projections using local and national data.

  **Results** A reduction of £300 000 could be achieved across England
  by improving prescribing behaviour, which equates to £250 per patient
  per year and 170 000 kg CO~2~e. These savings are unlikely to be
  released as cash from the service, but will lead to higher-value
  service provision at the same or lower cost. Most of these carbon
  emissions are attributable to the carbon footprint of the appointment
  -- 88 000 kg CO~2~e (including energy use and materials used) and the
  overprescribing of medication -- 66 000 kg CO~2~e.

  **Clinical implications** Psychiatrists need to review their
  prescribing practice of long-acting injections to reduce their impact
  on the National Health Service financial budget and the environment.

title: "Cost and carbon burden of long-acting injections: a sustainable
  evaluation"
---

The National Health Service (NHS) has committed to meeting the targets
of the Climate Change Act 2008, which entails reducing its carbon
footprint by 80% by 2050. As it stands, the carbon footprint for NHS
England is around 25 million of CO~2~e (carbon dioxide equivalent), of
which mental health services account for about 6%.^1^ Therefore, between
now and 2050 the necessary carbon reductions are in the order of 20
million tonnes of CO~2~e, of which about 1.2 million tonnes will need to
come from mental health services (assuming reductions occur
proportionally).^2^ Meeting these carbon reduction targets will require
a transformation in the way mental healthcare is delivered,^3^ as the
main component of the carbon footprint of healthcare is not its
buildings or energy use (only 17%), but factors relating to clinical
practice. The single largest component of this for mental healthcare is
pharmaceuticals.^2^

One way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the
quality of care is to eliminate inefficiencies in service provision.^4^
In this paper we explore one potential area for improvement -- the
overprescribing of long-acting injections for the treatment of mental
illness. More specifically, we assess the prescribing patterns of
injections of flupentixol decanoate for the treatment of schizophrenia
and identify areas of wastage.

We chose flupentixol because it is the most commonly administered
long-acting injection in the UK at 15 000 items per year.^5^
Furthermore, there is evidence that it is being prescribed at higher
doses and more frequently than studies suggest is beneficial. The
average prescription in the UK is 60 mg every 2 weeks^6^ and the
licensed dose limit is 400 mg per week, but a Cochrane review (based on
two small studies) found no evidence for clinical improvement from doses
higher than 50 mg every 4 weeks.^7^ Admittedly, randomised controlled
trials are poorly representative of naturalistic samples, but a more
recent study systematically reviewed eight studies, again with small
numbers and significant heterogeneity, and came to the same conclusions
about dose.^8^ Despite the small evidence base, evidence suggests there
is a maximum clinically effective dose that is considerably less than
the average prescribed dose.^8^

We used data from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust and extrapolated to
the national level to quantify the potential economic and environmental
impact to the NHS of prescribing flupentixol decanoate at higher doses
and higher frequency than is clinically beneficial.

# Method {#S1}

We collated the prescription details of all patients receiving
flupentixol decanoate at Oxford Health NHS Foundation trust in December
2013. The month was chosen at random and, given the long-term nature of
these prescriptions, there is no reason to expect it to differ from
other months.

Included in the data was information about the medication prescribed,
the materials used to administer it (syringe, needle, glass vial and
packaging), the number of appointments and travel to and from the
appointment for both patients and staff. Travel data were not from the
same patients, but were obtained from a survey conducted independently
by the Trust during the same period that included 100 rural and 100
urban patients (details available from the authors on request). No
information was available on cleaning materials and wasted medication so
we have assumed that neither makes a meaningful contribution to overall
resource use. The financial cost of heating and lighting the clinic
rooms were also excluded due to lack of data.

Conversion factors used to estimate the carbon footprint associated with
the materials are presented in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} and come
from either the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs or the
NHS Sustainable Development Unit. In order not to overestimate the
impact, we assumed the use of recycled materials, although this is
probably a conservative assumption. We assumed that an injection was
administered using a standard NHS 5 mL, 21G-VanishPoint intramuscular
needle and syringe and a 1 mL vial. For transport, we assumed small to
average-size cars. For the financial costs of medication, the cheapest
available estimates were used as derived from the *British National
Formulary 67* (BNF; [www.bnf.org](www.bnf.org)). The costs of needles
and syringes were from the NHS supply chain data
([www.supplychain.nhs.uk](www.supplychain.nhs.uk)) and the cost of
appointments from national databases.^9^ The administration of an
injection was assumed to require a 15-minute out-patient appointment
with a band 5 nurse and the costs included all overheads.

Travel survey at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, December 2013. Data
available from the authors on request.

Calculated as a sum of needle production factor (1222.0), syringe
production factor (2.138.0), paper packaging production factor (954.5),
glass vial production factor (508.0) and waste factor for each material
if recycled (21).

Including all overheads, administrative support, buildings, etc.
:::

We made two assumptions in calculating the costs and carbon footprints.
First, if flupentixol decanoate was prescribed, it was assumed to be
administered and second, the national average interval was assumed to be
the same as that found for Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, and not
the national average of 2 weeks. The latter again entails a conservative
estimate of the economic and environmental costs. For the national cost
of flupentixol, we used actual national data; all other costs were
extrapolated from Oxford data.

We calculated the economic and environmental savings that would occur if
all patients were given flupentixol decanoate injections according to
best practice, that is 50 mg every 4 weeks. We did this by identifying
the resources used to administer one injection; this involved measuring
all resources used and then attaching a financial and environmental cost
to the resources, as explained earlier. Annual costs per organisation
were calculated presuming that each organisation had the same number of
patients on long-term flupentixol decanoate injection, as was the case
for Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. National costs were calculated
based on national data that 15 000 prescriptions of flupentixol
decanoate were issued at a cost of £210 000 per year.^5^

# Results {#S2}

## Organisation-level analysis {#S3}

During December 2013, 28 patients attended 59 appointments for
flupentixol decanoate injection at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust.
The average interval was found to be 2.2 weeks, which is longer than the
national average of 2 weeks. The average dose was lower than the
national average: 46 mg per week (101 mg per injection) *v*. 60 mg per
week.^6^ There was considerable variation in both prescribing interval
and dose for patients. Prescribing intervals ranged from 1 to 4 weeks
and the dose ranged from 40 mg to 300 mg per week. The annual cost of
providing flupentixol decanoate to 28 patients at the Trust was £18 012
and its annual carbon footprint was 11 519 kg CO~2~e ([Table
2](#T2){ref-type="table"}).

## Extrapolation to the national level {#S4}

In estimating national costs, all figures remained the same and were
scaled up to the national level except for the cost of medication, which
was given as £210 000 spent on flupentixol decanoate injection per year
for 15 000 prescription items.^5^ This is costing the NHS in England
around £530 000 per year. Over 50% of these costs are due to the cost of
staff in the appointment at £285 000, followed by medication at £210
000. The carbon footprint of this service amounts to over 314 000 kg
CO~2~e across England, which is mostly attributable to the energy
required for the appointment (195 000 kg CO~2~e) and medication (90 300
kg CO~2~e). The economic and environmental costs of materials used for
the injection are minimal. The costs of travel are not large but remain
noteworthy at around £31 800 and 28 000 kg CO~2~e per year for England
([Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}).

Analysis of trust-level and national-level data reveals that the
dominant financial cost and carbon burden are associated with the
appointment. Medication is ranked in second place, whereas medical
consumables and travel are less significant costs and burdens. At a
national level, medication contributes a larger proportion; this is
because the cheapest BNF cost was used when analysing the Trust data.

## Potential savings associated with evidence-based administration {#S5}

Considerable environmental savings could be achieved across England by
changing prescribing behaviour to adhere to best practice.^6,7^ Analysis
suggests that around 166 000 kg CO~2~e could be saved, most of which is
attributable to the carbon footprint of the energy used in the
appointment (88 000 kg CO~2~e) and the potential over-prescribing of
medication (66 000 kg CO~2~e) ([Table 4](#T4){ref-type="table"}). This
equates to a saving of 168 kg CO~2~e per patient per year.

Considerable financial savings could also be achieved by changing
prescribing practices. The calculations suggest that around £297 000
could be saved across England by improving prescribing behaviour, which
equates to £250 per patient per year ([Table 4](#T4){ref-type="table"}).

# Discussion {#S6}

This paper demonstrates that appropriate dosing of flupentixol decanoate
would have economic and environmental benefits for the NHS. If all
prescriptions across England were given at the maximum 4-week interval
and at no more than the evidence-based maximal effective dose, around
£300 000 could theoretically be saved. This change in prescribing
practice would also lead to saving around 166 000 kg CO~2~e across
England per year. This potential overprescription of flupentixol
decanoate injection has the effect of increasing a patient\'s annual
carbon footprint by about 170 kg CO~2~e over and above that necessary
([Table 4](#T4){ref-type="table"}), which is the equivalent of a 2%
increase of the average carbon footprint per person in the UK (from 7.9
to 8.1 tonnes CO~2~).^10^ These savings also mean that, for this
particular service, they would also go a long way to meeting the Climate
Change Act targets of an 80% reduction in carbon footprint.

This analysis, although only based on 28 patients, could be generalised
to other settings. Rural settings would have an increased proportion of
costs associated with travel, whereas prescribing practices are likely
to vary across regions, as are team and individual management plans for
patients on flupentixol decanoate. Furthermore, some mental health
trusts have renewable energy sources on site that might considerably
reduce the carbon footprint associated with building energy use.

Some of these savings may not materialise in reality, as staff time and
resources are likely to be used for other patients. Furthermore, the
energy used to heat and light the building is unlikely to reduce much by
reducing appointment frequency, as the clinical facility is likely to
have other uses. It is, however, an important principle to reduce use of
unnecessary resources as it can enable potential savings to be used more
effectively elsewhere.^11^ This process creates a higher-value
healthcare system where resources such as funding, carbon and staff time
are released from some parts of the system to develop new services or
support struggling services.

There are two main issues that lead to unnecessary financial expenditure
and emissions of carbon dioxide. The first is the prescribing of
medication at doses higher than evidence suggests is beneficial and the
second is the administration of the injection at shorter intervals than
is necessary.^12^ Current trends of overprescribing may be attributable
to prescribing habits, personal experience or a result of the historical
use of higher doses. Overprescribing may also be due to a notable
clinical benefit at higher doses in some individuals.

An important finding here is that appointments appear to be a major
component of the carbon footprint for mental health services. If these
could be reduced, without compromising care, major savings could occur.
In this study, increased appointments are driven by the shorter
intervals between doses. Reasons for this might include convenience,
efficacy and the view that some patients deteriorate in the days before
the next dose is due, although this is not supported by evidence.^6^
Patients are often initially prescribed injections at 2-weekly
intervals, but perhaps this interval is not reviewed at subsequent
appointments leading to unnecessary use of appointments and
environmental resources. However, some patients are administered
injections every 2 weeks because it is clinically necessary to maintain
a 2-weekly clinical review and it is considered logical that the
injections should be administered at the same time. If these patients
are also prescribed within the evidence-based dose, then the savings
associated with medication cannot be included in this analysis; neither
can the savings attributed to the travel. In such cases, the potential
savings associated with increasing the interval of the injection are due
to the increased length of time needed during each appointment to
administer the injection and the material costs of the needle and
syringe. In this particular instance, based on reviewing the percentage
burden from each component in the analysis, the savings associated with
the increased time for each appointment are likely to be important but
the material use will not be (less than 1% of total burden). Thus, if
the appointment did not increase in its duration, then there would be no
incentive to increase the interval of the injection to 4 weeks.

Current prescribing practices can have a detrimental impact across the
three components of sustainability: environmental, economic and social.
The environmental and economic costs have been outlined, however, the
social costs may also be substantial, including increased frequency of
painful injections, time spent by the patient attending unnecessary
appointments, and an increased risk of extrapyramidal side-effects.^6^
The wider social cost of these side-effects is also likely to be
negative and may include reduced socialisation, reduced employment and
larger healthcare costs, which in turn will increase the carbon burden
and financial cost associated.

More evidence is needed to more clearly establish the maximally
effective dose of flupentixol decanoate as the implications of changing
prescribing behaviours can be substantial for the patients affected.
However, if current practice does not follow the current available
evidence, will additional economic and environmental savings make any
impact on doctors\' behaviours? Perhaps a culture change at all levels
is required to recognise the importance of reducing wasteful practice
and to develop a sense of stewardship over the use of clinical
resources.
