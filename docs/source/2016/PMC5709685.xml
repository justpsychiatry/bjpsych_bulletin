Job content in terms of the lack of scientific basis, poor prognosis and stigma towards psychiatry, work-related stress and problems with training jobs were common barriers highlighted among students and trainees, affecting recruitment.

About 3.6% of British graduates decide on a career in psychiatry whereas about 6% are needed.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> From 2000 to 2011, the absolute number of consultant psychiatrists in England rose from 2904 to 4394 (an increase of 51%), with similar increases in Scotland and Wales, in line with the expansion of the consultant workforce in most secondary care specialties.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A need for more psychiatric consultant posts has been predicted based on projections of increasing workloads due to the increased population needs.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A perceived fall in the proportion of UK medical school graduates choosing a postgraduate career in psychiatry, and low competition ratios for first-year core specialist training (CT1) posts in psychiatry,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> has led to many questions about the way in which psychiatry is taught at medical school and how psychiatry could be made as an attractive career option.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Low recruitment in psychiatry is a global issue, highlighted in a number of publications.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, the problem also has country-specific dimensions, as each country has different factors such as the pay scale for the specialty, medical education system and training programmes, which may attract or dissuade medical students from a career in psychiatry. The subject has not been reviewed systematically especially in the context of recruitment in the UK. The review question was: what are the factors that influence recruitment to psychiatry as a career choice and how can this be improved? The aim of this paper is to systematically review the literature from the UK on psychiatry as a career choice. We are specifically interested in identifying the factors that influence the recruitment into psychiatry with emphasis on barriers and facilitators affecting recruitment. A greater understanding of the views ranging from medical students to trainees and consultants working in the UK may enable curriculum developers and recruitment leads to design programmes that attract students and trainees to psychiatry as a career and improve students' attitudes towards psychiatry in the long term.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><p id="P6">We followed the PRISMA statement<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> as a guide for conducting the systematic review. The following electronic databases were searched from 1974 onwards: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO. These databases were selected in view of the fact that almost all the literature published from the UK would be covered in these databases. Keywords used in the searches included: medical students, trainees, doctors, consultant, attitudes, psychiatry, career, undergraduate psychiatry. Boolean operations and truncations were added to allow for alternative endings in the keyword searches. The search was last updated in August 2016.</p><p id="P7">We included studies that described a UK sample, were published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and provided original data on careers in psychiatry or factors affecting recruitment in psychiatry. We excluded studies that had the primary objective of addressing other issues that were not directly relevant to recruitment in psychiatry but only mentioned their effects on career choice as a secondary effect. Studies which provided data on medical careers in general were included if these provided data relevant to psychiatric careers or recruitment.</p><p id="P8">The electronic search returned 601 relevant abstracts and titles. We screened the titles and abstracts and excluded the studies that were not directly relevant to the objectives of the review. Therefore we excluded the studies that did not describe a UK sample or did not provide the original data. We also excluded the studies that described the recruitment to certain subspecialties and therefore not relevant to the recruitment to psychiatry in general. After screening these titles and abstracts we decided to examine 56 full text papers. Finally, we included 27 papers in the review. Further details are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The studies were conducted in a number of different populations, settings and periods, and also used diverse methodologies varying from surveys to statistics derived from databases. The 30-item Attitudes Towards Psychiatry (ATP-30),<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> a validated tool used to assess attitudes of students towards psychiatry, was used in four papers; other papers used different questionnaires to assess attitudes. Due to the diverse methodologies it was inappropriate to pool the data to produce a statistical summary. We therefore describe the main findings and produce a narrative summary of results.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="margin"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Summary of the abstracts reviewed to identify relevant papers.

This correlates with earlier findings by Shah <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> that found a significant correlation between those Scottish students considering psychiatry as a career and having held a psychiatry post.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> A recent survey by Denman <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> showed that 43% of psychiatry trainees made their decision to specialise in psychiatry during the foundation years, correlating with increased exposure to psychiatry during the foundation years with 80% of trainees in this survey completing a post in psychiatry during the foundation years. Specific enrichment activities beyond standard teaching and clinical placements such as research experience in psychiatry, university psychiatry clubs, summer schools,<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> psychiatry electives and psychiatry special study modules appear to be a way in which medical students will gain invaluable experiences and improve their attitudes to psychiatry. These need to be adopted and evaluated in future programmes to enhance recruitment in psychiatry Collier <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> found that only 2.3% of teaching was dedicated to psychiatry compared with 44.1% to medical and surgical topics, which does not help the poor image of psychiatry. This and similar issues need to be addressed at institutional level.</p><p id="P73">A number of studies found that psychiatry has a perception that it is not a &#x02018;scientific&#x02019; or &#x02018;medical&#x02019; discipline.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Medical students and trainees expressed the views about the weakened medical identity of psychiatry. The erosion of the role of the psychiatrist was cited by some psychiatry trainees as a potential factor that would make them consider leaving psychiatry training.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> This unfortunately is not helped by negative comments or &#x02018;bad-mouthing&#x02019; of psychiatry.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p><p id="P74">Interventions such as anti-stigma films and Medfest<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> have been shown to improve medical students' attitudes to psychiatrists, serious mental illness and psychiatry, at least in the short term.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> However, it appears that there is need to reconsider the content of psychiatric training and the undergraduate curriculum. It has been suggested that moving undergraduate teaching from in-patient to general hospital settings such as liaison psychiatry will allow students to see patients with problems that are relevant to medical practice.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Setting up and evaluating such programmes that have the potential to offer a different and enjoyable experience for medical students and foundation doctors should be a priority to improve the image of and recruitment into psychiatry.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P75">A limitation of the study is that almost all data are based on surveys and databases. This represents a cross-sectional view on the subject. The lack of any comparisons with other specialties, which may have similar recruitment rates, is particularly concerning. The focus on UK studies is also a limitation but was necessary to understand the factors affecting recruitment in this country We noted with some concern that there are only a few studies that address the positive aspects of psychiatry,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> which may attract students and trainees towards psychiatry, and how these can be used for improving the recruitment. Future studies need to address this gap in the literature. Finally, we feel that the problems underlying the recruitment in psychiatry perhaps also reflect the lack of parity of esteem. Unless mental health is valued equally with physical health, the misconceptions and distorted perceptions about psychiatry as a discipline in which a medical career can be fruitfully pursued will linger on and will hinder aspiring physicians from considering psychiatry as a career option.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">
