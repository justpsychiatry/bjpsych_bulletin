  **Aims and method** Community treatment orders (CTOs) are increasingly
  embedded into UK practice and their use continues to rise. However,
  they remain highly controversial. We surveyed psychiatrists to
  establish their experiences and current opinions of using CTOs and to
  compare findings with our previous survey conducted in 2010.

  **Results** The opinions of psychiatrists in the UK have not changed
  since 2010 in spite of recent evidence questioning the effectiveness
  of CTOs. Clinical factors (the need for engagement and treatment
  adherence, and the achievement of adherence and improved insight)
  remain the most important considerations in initiating and discharging
  a CTO.

  **Clinical implications** Given the accumulating evidence from
  research and clinical practice that CTOs do not improve outcomes, it
  is concerning that psychiatrists\' opinions have not altered in
  response, particularly given the implications for patient care.

title: "Community treatment orders in the UK 5 years on: a repeat
  national survey of psychiatrists"
---

Community treatment orders (CTOs) have been available in Scotland since
2005 and in England and Wales since 2008. The provision of powers to
compel in the community was controversial within the healthcare and
legal professions, among those who use services and among organisations
working on their behalf. Indeed, an alliance was formed in 2008 in
England and Wales of 32 different organisations from all these
stakeholder groups to express concern regarding the proposed
introduction.^1^ In Scotland a CTO can be commenced in the community,
whereas in England and Wales it can only be made when a patient is
discharged from involuntary treatment in hospital. The most common
discretionary conditions written into the orders are to take medication
and to see clinical team members, although powers are potentially wider.

In England and Wales the CTO is initiated by the clinician. This is
entirely discretionary and there are no situations in which one must be
used. In Scotland the decision to grant a CTO rests with the mental
health tribunal, on the advice of clinicians and mental health officers.
This allows considerable scope for variation in practice. Defferent
factors influencing the variable use of CTOs have been proposed by
Dawson,^2^ including: the legal structure of the CTO regimethe community
mental health services availablethe clinician\'s and practitioner\'s
views about the possible impact of coercion on their relationships with
patientsthe expectations of third parties.

Attitudes of psychiatrists in England and Wales were surveyed by
Crawford *et al*^3^ in 2000, when 45% of the 1171 respondents were in
favour of a system allowing CTOs. In our survey of psychiatrists in
England and Wales shortly after the introduction of CTOs this proportion
had risen to 60%.^4^

Since their introduction in England and Wales, CTOs have been used
extensively. The Care Quality Commission reported that 18 942 CTOs had
been used in England and Wales by 31 March 2013 and on that date 5218
patients were on a CTO.^5^ The overall number of patients subject to a
CTO shows a year on year increase of 10%.^5^ The only randomised
controlled study of the effectiveness of CTOs^1^ included 333
participants and demonstrated no difference between those subject to a
CTO and those not over a 12-month period across a wide range of
outcomes. The study has proved to be controversial and engendered a
number of critical commentaries.^6^

In Scotland, where CTOs have been available for longer, their use has
also increased, to the extent that in 2013--2014 they accounted for 41%
of the total number of compulsory treatment orders, reflecting a
significant drop in the number of hospital-based orders (the remaining
59% of all compulsory treatment orders) and consequently, a continued
shift to the community for people subject to compulsion.^7^ Given these
trends, we decided to compare and contrast the views of psychiatrists
north and south of the border.

# Study design {#S1}

We conducted a national survey using an adapted version of the
instrument developed by Manning *et al*,^4^ which in turn was based on a
survey of clinicians in New Zealand conducted 10 years after CTOs were
introduced there.^8^ We aimed to determine psychiatrists\' views
regarding CTOs now and to assess any changes over time and differences
across context.

# Method {#S2}

## Sample {#S3}

The link to the survey was sent by email (from the Royal College of
Psychiatrists) to all consultant psychiatrists listed as members of the
General Adult Psychiatry and the Rehabilitation and Social Psychiatry
Faculties at the beginning of June 2014. A reminder was sent after 3
weeks. No responses were accepted after 8 weeks. To avoid any
duplications only one response from any one IP address would be
accepted.

## Survey instrument {#S4}

We made minimal alterations to Manning\'s questionnaire to maximise
comparability with that survey and with the earlier New Zealand
study.^8^ The survey included questions asking the respondents to rate
the importance of a range of factors influencing CTO practice or
statements about CTOs using five-point Likert scales (from 1, very
important/strongly agree to 5, not important at all/strongly disagree).
Respondents were also asked about sociodemographic information and the
number of CTOs they had applied for.

Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 17 for Windows.
A descriptive analysis was carried out with data presented as
appropriate for the distribution (mean and standard deviation for
normally distributed data, median and interquartile range for
non-normally distributed data, and number and proportion for categorical
data).

# Results {#S5}

Of the 3534 psychiatrists emailed, 364 responses were received. The
response rate (10.3%) is lower than that of the original survey (37%)
and the New Zealand survey (44%), both of which used hard copy
questionnaires and not electronic ones. Where appropriate, we compare
our results with our first survey from 2010 and the New Zealand study.

The majority of the respondents (*n*=327) were based in England and
Wales and 37 were from Scotland. These numbers approximately reflect the
differing populations of the countries concerned. The ethnicity and
gender of respondents did not differ significantly from the overall
membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.^9,10^ Most (85%) had
been working in psychiatry for longer than 10 years.

The mean number of CTOs applied for was 15, with a reported range from 0
to 100. There was significant variation between posts in terms of the
use of CTOs in routine practice, with understandably marked differences
between, for example, in-patient and community services. The
overwhelming majority of respondents (86%) reported that none of their
applications for CTOs had been turned down.

Many respondents added written comments, suggesting high levels of
interest in the topic, as also reported in our previous survey.

## CTO impact on the therapeutic relationship {#S6}

When asked about the therapeutic relationship, 24% of respondents in
England and Wales believed that CTOs help the relationship, 10% that
they hinder it and 56% that they both help and hinder it. In Scotland
the figures were 18%, 0% and 76% respectively.

## Important factors in the decision to use a CTO {#S7}

The survey presented 11 factors and asked the respondent to rate their
relative importance when deciding to use a CTO. The most important
factor for responders in England and Wales was 'To ensure contact with
mental health professionals', and 'Promoting compliance with medication'
was ranked second. The five reasons deemed most important were the same
in all four surveys over time and location. These results are summarised
in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"}.

Thirty-four respondents added additional reasons such as 'to make the
patient feel more secure', 'to establish insight' or 'to gradually
promote a sense of independence'.

## Important factors in the decision to discharge a patient from a CTO {#S8}

Development of insight and adherence to treatment were rated as the most
important factors in discharging patients from CTOs. The mean ratings
suggest that these were considered very important. Again, the five most
important factors were the same in all four surveys. These results are
summarised in [Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"}.

## Mechanisms influencing how CTOs work {#S9}

Respondents were presented with nine possible mechanisms by which CTOs
may affect outcome. The three mechanisms deemed most important were
ensuring medication adherence, ensuring a greater period of stability,
and signalling to the patient that they have severe mental illness. In
Scotland the first two were endorsed but the third most influential
factor was the binding of services to the patient, with 'signalling'
being just behind in fourth position. These results are summarised in
[Table 3](#T3){ref-type="table"}.

SMI, serious mental illness.

Rating: 1, very important; 3, neutral; 5, not important.
:::

## The importance of factors that may undermine the effectiveness of CTOs {#S10}

The results here are the same as our earlier survey, with substance
misuse (mean rating 1.92), lack of adequate supported accommodation
(mean rating 2.23), and failure to enforce adherence (mean rating 2.31)
being seen as most important. The ranking of factors was the same in
both England and Wales surveys and in the Scottish 2014 sample.

## Factors important in the introduction of CTOs {#S11}

The rank order of perceived significance of factors behind the
introduction of CTOs as listed in this survey was as follows for
respondents in England and Wales (a rating of 1 indicates strong
agreement, 3 indicates a neutral stance and 5 strong disagreement; mean
ratings are given in brackets: the lower the mean rating, the higher the
factor significance): to enforce better community services and follow-up
for those most at risk (2.22)as a response to public pressure (in
respect to acts of violence committed by mentally ill patients) (2.45)as
a result of procedural evolution -- moving from Sections 17 and 25 (of
the Mental Health Act 1983) to more explicit framework for treating
those with mental illness in the community (2.51)to reduce pressure on
acute psychiatric beds (2.89)to reduce coercion by reducing length of
stay in psychiatric hospitals (2.95)as a result of international
research evidence (3.53). There is no difference in the listed ranking
from our first survey.^4^ The results for Scottish respondents are
different in that the 'public pressure' factor is rated of less
importance (3.31).

### Support for the introduction and use of CTOs {#S12}

We asked clinicians to rate their level of agreement with several
statements regarding CTOs (mean ratings are given in brackets): 'CTOs
complement existing legislation to provide a greater choice of treatment
options' (2.37)'The increase in compulsory powers is appropriate for the
potential clinical and social benefits' (2.40)'I supported the
introduction of CTOs' (2.55)'There is sufficient clinical guidance to
feel confident placing patients on CTO' (2.60)'I can already see the
benefits of the use of CTOs' (2.63). Those statements with a mean of
over 3, suggesting disagreement, were: 'The introduction of CTOs will
have no long-term benefit' (3.17)'Well-resourced community services can
provide the same benefits without using compulsory powers' (3.22)'There
is insufficient clinical evidence to feel comfortable placing patients
on CTO' (3.46)'The introduction of CTOs was a retrograde step for mental
health services' (3.59).

## Factors discouraging clinicians from using CTOs {#S13}

Mean scores here tended to cluster around the mid-range, suggesting less
clearly held beliefs and opinions than in other areas of the survey. The
most important discouraging factors were considered to be concern for
civil liberties (mean rating 2.29), administrative burden (mean rating
2.31), and the degree of coercion involved (mean rating 2.41). Lack of
evidence to support effectiveness was ranked fourth most important (mean
rating 2.51). No other factors had mean ratings below 3 (a level that
suggests general agreement). Comparing the four surveys across time and
geography, there are again remarkably few differences.

## Should Section 17 or CTOs be used in community care? {#S14}

Respondents in England and Wales were asked to compare the use of CTO
and Section 17 leave from hospital: 58% believed that CTOs were a more
appropriate way of treating patients in the community than the medium-
to long-term use of Section 17 leave and the majority believed they were
less coercive (48% *v*. 23%). There was widespread belief (expressed by
61% of respondents) that in clinical care there was a significant
difference in powers between Section 17 leave and CTOs.

## Contrasts between jurisdictions {#S15}

There was some variation in opinions expressed on CTOs incorporating
medical treatment that is 'likely to prevent a disorder worsening or
likely to alleviate the symptoms or effects of the disorder': 47% of
respondents from England and Wales and 68% of Scottish respondents
agreed. Further, 84% of Scottish respondents agreed that it should be
possible to place a patient not currently under detention on a CTO, but
only 36% of respondents in England and Wales did so. There were also
differences between jurisdictions regarding significantly impaired
decision-making ability (SIDMA) as a criterion for CTO use: 80% of
psychiatrists in Scotland and 28% of those in England and Wales accepted
it. This is a criterion in the Scottish legislation (Mental Health (Care
and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003) but not in England and Wales (Mental
Health Act 1983). Even though the number of respondents from Scotland
was relatively small at 37, and we did not believe as a result that
detailed analysis was appropriate, important differences do appear to be
present in attitudes and beliefs.

# Discussion {#S16}

The results of this survey are strikingly similar overall to the
previous survey in England and Wales conducted when these powers were
relatively new in those countries. Nearly 6 years on, with no measurable
reductions in bed use or improved outcomes from clinical practice or
research,^11--15^ the use of CTOs continues to increase.^5,6^

It is likely that the reasons for this are complex and relate to factors
within both clinicians and the systems they operate in. In a
discretionary system where there is never a situation where a CTO must
be enacted, the opinions and beliefs of senior clinicians, particularly
psychiatrists, are likely to be influential. Clinical factors remain by
far the most important in decisions to initiate or discharge a CTO.
These have been the same in all four studies spanning time and
geography.^3,4,8,16^ The key factors were as follows: to ensure contact
with professionals, to promote medication adherence, and to identify
relapse and protect the individual from its consequences. Similarly, the
factors in deciding when to discharge a CTO have been remarkably stable:
development of insight, treatment adherence, clinical improvement and
reduced risk to others and self (in that order).

Clinicians reported feeling discouraged by concerns for civil liberties
and the additional administrative burden when considering CTOs. Factors
believed to undermine CTOs were substance misuse, lack of supported
accommodation and failure to enforce adherence.

The written comments of a number of respondents expressed frustration
around how the in-patient/out-patient split complicates practice. A
number commented also that a general pressure on beds may lead to
inappropriate use of CTOs to facilitate early discharge or to make
readmission 'easier' if needed. Clearly these raise ethical concerns if
compulsory powers are being commonly used as a practical measure to
access services that should be available regardless of legal status. It
has also been reported anecdotally that clinicians feel pressurised to
use CTOs in case there is a negative outcome such as suicide or
aggression and they are criticised for not having done so.

It seems likely that clinicians across the UK will continue to use CTOs
in large numbers as long as they remain available. New evidence, both in
the form of large-scale utilisation data and research studies,^1,7,17^
has not affected opinion significantly. This is of concern in a branch
of medical science that ostensibly embraces evidence-based practice. It
seems crucial therefore that we continue to evaluate our practice,^18^
gather good-quality evidence, and pay attention to it to facilitate
greater understanding and sophistication in the use of compulsion. This
will better serve our patients.
