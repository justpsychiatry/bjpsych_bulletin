  **Aims and method** Using a retrospective observational approach, we
  aimed to discern whether there was a difference in metabolic
  parameters between psychiatric and general practice populations in the
  same locality. Second, we aimed to establish differences in metabolic
  parameters of patients taking olanzapine, clozapine or aripiprazole.

  **Results** Patients with psychiatric illness had a body mass index
  (BMI) comparable to that of the general practice population (28.7 *v*.
  29.7 kg/m^2^), but blood glucose was significantly lower in the
  general practice population (4.8 *v*. 6.1 mmol/L). Olanzapine was
  associated with the lowest BMI (26.1 kg/m^2^) and aripiprazole the
  highest (32.2 kg/m^2^), with no difference in blood glucose between
  antipsychotics.

  **Clinical implications** Awareness of environmental factors and how
  they affect individuals is important and medications are not the only
  cause of metabolic effects. There may be a channelling bias present,
  meaning practitioners are cognisant of potential metabolic effects
  prior to prescribing. Overall monitoring of physical health is
  important regardless of potential cause.

title: Body mass index and blood glucose in psychiatric and general
  practice populations
---

Patients with severe and enduring mental illness experience excess
mortality, which appears to be linked to socioeconomic deprivation.^1^
Increased cardiovascular mortality is seen in such patient groups and
recording of cardiovascular risk factors occurs at an earlier age.^2^
With regard to risk factors for cardiovascular disease, our accepted
knowledge has become that the oral antipsychotics olanzapine^3,4^ and
clozapine^5,6^ are most likely to be associated with weight gain,
thereby high body mass index (BMI), potential diabetes mellitus and
adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Indeed, their propensity for causing
weight gain may correlate positively with antipsychotic
effectiveness.^7^ The second-generation antipsychotic aripiprazole has
been considered to cause less weight gain than for example clozapine or
olanzapine. Large head-to-head Cochrane reviews support differences in
such comparative weight gain favouring aripiprazole in randomised
controlled trials.^8^ However, the authors of this Cochrane review
questioned whether this translates to similar findings in clinical
practice.

In clinical practice, antipsychotic medications are prescribed for
various mental disorders. Clinicians are informed about likely
beneficial and adverse effects of different antipsychotics by a number
of sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, attended symposia and,
perhaps more controversially, directly by pharmaceutical companies. The
last does give rise to potential bias in data presentation and
interpretation.

# Method {#S1}

We aimed to identify psychiatric patient cohorts in our locality. This
was with a view to examining the three antipsychotics of interest which
are implicated in weight change and blood glucose regulation:
olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole. We examined routine health
measures including BMI, blood glucose and other parameters detailed
below. The psychiatric populations identified were those with severe and
enduring mental illness (*n* = 46), acute admissions to general
psychiatry (*n* = 36) and admissions to the psychiatric intensive care
unit (PICU) (*n* = 39). The total of the psychiatric population (*n* =
121) was compared with individuals from two local general practices who
had presented for a routine physical health check-up (*n* = 80). The
general practice population were identified as non-diabetic and not on
antipsychotic medication. The project was registered with our clinical
quality department.

Patients with severe and enduring mental illness were invited by letter
to attend a physical health screening clinic. An information sheet which
explained the importance of such an intervention was also sent out.
Written consent was obtained from patients at the first meeting and it
was explained that this new initiative was not designed to replace the
annual general practice screening but instead to supplement it. The
clinic was run by registered mental health nurses and trained clinical
support workers. The rationale behind choosing the specific groups of
patients was to examine a mix of patients seen routinely within clinical
psychiatry. Those with severe and enduring mental illness were
considered most likely to have the longest duration of contact with
psychiatric services and theoretically greatest lifetime exposure to
antipsychotic medication. Those from the acute admissions unit and PICU
may have had less exposure to antipsychotic medication. The general
practice group would serve as a comparison with no recorded exposure to
antipsychotics.

We examined the link between the use of antipsychotics with perceived
different propensities for weight gain (olanzapine, clozapine and
aripiprazole) and associations with BMI and blood glucose levels.
Long-acting antipsychotic injections were also analysed as a comparator.
We also scrutinised duration of exposure to the antipsychotic in
question and also any antipsychotic prescribed beforehand. This was to
discern whether the antipsychotic of interest had been prescribed for a
relatively short period of time and whether the previously prescribed
antipsychotic may have influenced BMI and blood glucose changes. Our
primary null hypothesis was that in clinical practice, BMI and blood
glucose levels for the psychiatric population would not differ
significantly from the local general practice population. Our secondary
null hypothesis was that in clinical practice there would be no
differences in BMI or blood glucose between the antipsychotics of
interest. For nominal data one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
corresponding two-tailed *t*-tests were performed. For categorical data
the χ^2^ or Fisher exact statistic was used.

# Results {#S2}

[Table 1](#T1){ref-type="table"} shows clinical, physical and lifestyle
measures for the psychiatric and general practice populations. The
psychiatric population had a greater proportion of men (*P* = 0.03) and
was significantly older than the general practice population (t(173) =
7.5, *P*\<0.0001). The BMI of psychiatric and general practice patients
did not differ significantly, but was 1 kg/m^2^ lower in the psychiatric
population. The general practice cohort had significantly lower blood
glucose measures than psychiatric patients (t(130) = 5.1, *P*\<0.0001).
Mean blood pressure was within acceptable limits, but 9.1% of the
psychiatric patients and 20% of the general practice population had a
diastolic pressure equal to or greater than 90 mmHg.

[Table 2](#T2){ref-type="table"} describes the pattern of antipsychotic
prescription across the different psychiatric cohorts. In terms of our
antipsychotics of interest, olanzapine was used in 15.7%, clozapine in
9% and aripiprazole in 11.6% of all psychiatric patient groups combined.
Median and range of lifetime cumulative daily dosage for the specific
antipsychotics were as follows: aripiprazole 14.4 mg/day (5.0--31.3),
olanzapine 16.6 mg/day (5.0--22.2) and clozapine 390 mg/day (250--470).
Antipsychotic polypharmacy occurred in three patients on olanzapine, two
patients on aripiprazole and one patient on clozapine.

Online Table DS1 describes in further detail the three antipsychotics;
in addition to mean dose which was also given in [Table
2](#T2){ref-type="table"}, median treatment durations with ranges were
also recorded. The median duration of treatment was lengthy at 350 days
for olanzapine, 735 for clozapine and 315 for aripiprazole. Table DS1
contains previously prescribed medications as these may also have had an
influence, particularly in patients who had been on one of the three
antipsychotics for a short duration. In the case of aripiprazole, two
patients had been on olanzapine for a median duration of 920 days and
five patients had been on quetiapine for a median duration of 393 days.
The dosage and duration of long-acting antipsychotic injection prior to
the initiation of clozapine and aripiprazole was of interest. Patients
eventually commencing clozapine were treated with much higher median
percentage BNF maximum dosage^9^ allowed than those commencing
aripiprazole (62.3% *v*. 6.8%). In addition, patients eventually
commencing clozapine were treated for a much longer median duration of
long-acting antipsychotic injection (991 *v*. 256 days).

# Discussion {#S3}

Our primary null hypothesis was that in clinical practice, BMI and blood
glucose levels for psychiatric populations would not differ
significantly from the local non-psychiatric population, which was
supported for BMI. For the psychiatric population several factors may be
considered in addition to antipsychotic medication-induced weight gain.
Such patients often suffer from lack of motivation as part of their
primary mental disorder or possible comorbid mental or substance use
disorder. They may be more likely to neglect their physical health,^10^
perform less exercise and make poor dietary choices either by habit or
relative expense of some healthy foods including fresh fruit and
vegetables. For the general practice population, other factors may be
considered including poor dietary choices (high-sugar, high-calorie
foods) and convenience of take-away or ready-to-microwave meals.

The Scottish mean BMI in 2012 was 27.3 kg/m^2^ for both men and women.
The mean BMI of adults aged 16--64 increased from 25.8 kg/m^2^ in 1995
to 27.1 kg/m^2^ in 2012, with little change since 2008.^11^ Our general
practice cohort mean BMI was 2.6 kg/m^2^ higher than the Scottish
average. Interestingly, a study from New York found high BMI to be an
independent risk factor for re-admission to an in-patient psychiatric
unit.^12^ Incidentally, the study\'s median BMI at 28.5 kg/m^2^ was
comparable to our psychiatric populations. In our locality, Lanarkshire,
Scotland, 65% of adults are defined as overweight, that is, their BMI is
25 kg/m^2^ or above.^13^ In our severe and enduring mental illness
population 81% and in the general practice population 72% had a BMI of
25 kg/m^2^ or above. Being overweight is a known risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.^14^

In terms of blood glucose level, our null hypothesis was not supported
-- blood glucose levels were significantly lower in the general practice
population than in the psychiatric population. Again, antipsychotics and
other psychotropic medications may be important aetiological factors
along with poor dietary choices, with high sugar, fat and salt content
in ready or microwave-prepared meals as seen in clinical practice.
Schizophrenia and diabetes have been associated comorbid conditions long
before antipsychotic medications became available.^15^ A contemporary
study of 1642 patients from Australia showed that psychosis itself was
associated with insulin resistance as well as high BMI. These findings
were seen at a relatively early age, even prior to the start of
treatment with antipsychotics^16^ and we support the view of the authors
who recommend close monitoring and adherence to guidelines^17^ for all
patients commenced on antipsychotics who may be at risk of metabolic
syndrome. Our relatively elevated blood glucose measures for the
psychiatric populations may suggest insulin resistance which is a
precursor of type 2 diabetes mellitus and therefore an additional risk
factor for cardiovascular disease.^18^

Our secondary null hypothesis was that in clinical practice, there would
be no differences between the three antipsychotics of interest regarding
BMI or blood glucose when compared with patients on all other
antipsychotics. For blood glucose this null hypothesis was supported.
Our blood glucose findings were in keeping with a large systematic
review of randomised controlled trials (total *n* = 6239) looking at
mostly aripiprazole *v*. olanzapine for the treatment of
schizophrenia.^19^ However, for BMI our null hypothesis was not
supported. The findings seemed counterintuitive in that patients on
aripiprazole had a significantly higher mean BMI compared with other
antipsychotics. We considered that prior to aripiprazole, two patients
had been on olanzapine and five on quetiapine for a significantly long
period of time. This may have contributed to the overall high mean BMI
seen in the aripiprazole group. A further consideration is that
aripiprazole may have been prescribed specifically for patients who had
already gained weight from the effects of a previously prescribed
antipsychotic. This phenomenon is known as channelling bias and occurs
in observational studies. Observational studies are limited in that
causality cannot be inferred. Channelling bias is well recognised and
can be mitigated.^20^ However, in our study the lengthy median duration
of treatment with aripiprazole at 315 days supports the significant
influence of aripiprazole itself in terms of final mean BMI.
Furthermore, olanzapine, an antipsychotic known to have a propensity for
causing early weight gain, was associated with a statistically
significantly lower mean BMI compared with aripiprazole and clozapine.
Prior to olanzapine treatment, the antipsychotics prescribed did not
give rise to suggestions for why this body mass finding occurred, for
example, many patients had been on potentially weight-neutral
antipsychotics for a significant period beforehand. The possibility of
channelling bias or actively, or perhaps even subconsciously, selecting
patients who had a relatively low BMI to start with as being suitable
for being commenced on olanzapine may be a consideration. The position
that olanzapine is associated with higher BMI and blood glucose levels
compared with other antipsychotics was not supported by our findings.
This is in keeping with the finding that people who already had a high
BMI at the start of treatment may not put on as much weight or that
there is a plateau effect at around 39 weeks with long-term treatment
with olanzapine.^21^ Our cohort of olanzapine patients had a median
duration of treatment of 50 weeks (350 days) suggesting that this
plateau period had been reached.

## Limitations {#S4}

There were some important limitations to this study. There were
significant differences in gender distribution and age between the
psychiatric and general practice populations. The observational nature
of the study does not support suggestions about causality in any
direction in terms of BMI, blood glucose or other physiological
parameters from particular antipsychotic medications. Randomised
controlled trials allow speculation about causality, however, stringent
entry requirements for randomised controlled trials exclude many
patients seen in clinical practice which our clinical cohorts represent.
Due to limitations of data we were unable to report on other important
potential metabolic disturbances with the three main drugs of interest,
for example, cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein.
The sample size of our severe and enduring mental illness group was
relatively small (*n* = 46) and consisted mainly of patients with
diagnoses of bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia. Attendance at
the physical health monitoring clinic was on a voluntary basis and this
may result in a participation bias. This meant that individuals with the
most severe debilitating illness and those troubled primarily by
negative symptoms, particularly lack of motivation to attend the
physical health screening clinic, may have effectively been excluded
from our findings. To reliably report our main findings replication with
larger psychiatric and general practice populations would be necessary.
We would like to underline the importance of further potential
confounding effects of other medications which may have an effect on
weight gain, for example, lithium, other mood stabilisers and
antidepressant medications, antipsychotic polypharmacy (for our
psychiatric population *n* = 8), other polypharmacy such as treatment
with anti-hypertensive or anti-diabetic medications, and pre-existing
medical conditions such as hypothyroidism.

Although BMI recording is now part of routine psychiatric assessment in
our locality for both community and in-patients, we were not able to
report on BMI or blood glucose at the commencement of antipsychotic
medication. We strongly recommend this as part of the careful assessment
of patients starting on antipsychotics, particularly as studies show
that early rapid weight gain predicts further long-term weight gain and
there are effective strategies to counteract this.^22^
