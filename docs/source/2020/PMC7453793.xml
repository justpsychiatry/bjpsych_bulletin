This includes a decrease in relapse and rates of readmission to hospital.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The efficacy and implementation of carer involvement has therefore received much attention in research and carer involvement policies and guidelines are widely promoted in mental healthcare internationally (for example from the UK National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and UK Department of Health and Social Care<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>). However, the literature lacks an examination of fundamental conceptual issues,<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> the exploration of which might help us to better understand why carer involvement is so widely promoted in theory yet so poorly or inconsistently implemented in practice, both in the UK and internationally.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>&#x02018;Carer&#x02019; is a policy-derived term, which aims to value the contribution that family members and friends make to patients&#x02019; care. However, there is a need to explore how the &#x02018;carer&#x02019; role is actually understood by patients, their family members and friends and front-line clinicians. This is especially pertinent in hospital settings, as patients may be admitted to hospital following the deterioration of relationships or as a result of a breakdown in their usual social support networks.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> There is therefore value in exploring this topic to better understand how &#x02018;carers&#x02019; are viewed in the context of mental healthcare, and how this might have an impact on the nature of their involvement in patients&#x02019; care.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2" id="sec1-2" sec-type="other"><title>Research question</title><p>How do patients, carers and clinicians conceptualise the role of carers in the context of mental healthcare and in-patient settings?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="other"><title>Design</title><p>Focus groups were conducted with patients, carers and clinicians to explore their opinions and experiences of carer involvement in in-patient mental healthcare. The groups were conducted as part of a larger study of stakeholders&#x02019; views on what carer involvement in in-patient mental healthcare should entail, and the methodology is described in further detail in a separate article.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> For the present part of the study, the topic guide contained questions and prompts pertaining to participants&#x02019; conceptualisations of what the carer role entails, and the use of the term &#x02018;carer&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="other"><title>Participants</title><p>Purposive sampling was used to recruit patients and carers through the East London NHS Foundation Trust in-patient and out-patient mental health services as well as local service user and carer organisations located in the London Boroughs of Hackney, Newham and Tower Hamlets. Advertisements were put on social media (Twitter and Facebook). All clinicians who participated in the study worked in in-patient services at the East London NHS Foundation Trust.</p><p>Maximum variation sampling was used to ensure a diverse sample of participants across mental health settings (acute in-patient units, triage wards, community settings), local boroughs and, in the case of staff, job positions. Patient and carer participants were recruited both from settings where a patient was currently in hospital, and from those who had been admitted to hospital within the past 5 years. Additionally, carers were recruited from both settings where an individual might already self-identify as a &#x02018;carer&#x02019; (for example carer organisations) and settings where they might not do so (for example by being approached by a clinician when they visit a relative in hospital). Carers could also self-refer by responding to adverts shared widely via email lists, Twitter and bulletin boards. The advert did not use the word &#x02018;carer&#x02019; but instead asked &#x02018;have you or someone you support ever been admitted to hospital for mental health reasons?&#x02019;. This was to attract participants with potentially wide-ranging views on the &#x02018;carer&#x02019; role, as well as those who were not familiar with the term &#x02018;carer&#x02019;.</p><p>Sample size was initially planned on the basis of aiming for 6&#x02013;8 participants per focus group, and 6&#x02013;12 groups in total, as recommended by Finch, Lewis &#x00026; Turley (cited in Ritchie et al).<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This was envisaged to allow for active participation for all members while giving individuals opportunities for more detailed discussion. However, adjustments were made for each group type, for example carers and clinicians were invited in higher numbers, to allow for the possibility that a proportion would cancel because of caring or working responsibilities.</p><p>Patients over 18 years old who were able to provide informed consent, had experience of admission to psychiatric hospital (within 5 years) and sufficient command of English were eligible for the study. Carers were eligible if they were over 18 years old, had experience of supporting someone who was admitted to psychiatric hospital (within 5 years) and sufficient command of English. Clinicians had to have current experience of working in acute in-patient settings.</p><p>Potentially eligible patients who were identified by clinicians were asked permission to receive further information from researchers about the study. Patients, carers and clinicians who self-referred were also given the opportunity to discuss details of the study with the researcher, before arranging to attend a focus group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="other"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. Ethical and institutional approvals were provided by the East London NHS Foundation Trust and the East of England &#x02013; Essex NHS Research Ethics Committee (ref:15/EE/0456). All participants provided their written informed consent to take part in the study, as well as providing verbal consent to begin recording.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="other"><title>Procedures</title><p>Focus groups were facilitated by two researchers, with at least one clinically experienced and able to provide support if any of the participants became distressed or agitated. Except for one mixed patient&#x02013;carer group, separate focus groups were conducted with carers, patients and clinicians to account for possible counterproductive dynamics between the groups and ensure that each group could express their views freely. Although up to ten participants were sought for most of the focus groups, smaller groups of three to five participants were arranged with patients who were currently in hospital, to minimise overstimulation and allow each participant to share their opinions comfortably.</p><p>A topic guide was developed based on guidance in Ritchie et al<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and was designed to facilitate up to 90&#x000a0;minutes of discussion. Each of the three participant groups had a slightly amended version of the same topic guide, so that the questions were relevant to them as patients, carers or clinicians. The initial aim of the guide was to gather opinions to develop a carer involvement intervention to be used in in-patient settings. After introductions and ground-rule setting, two main topics were introduced, each with a set of questions, probes and prompts to encourage active participation of all members. The discussion topics began (a) generally, asking participants about their views on carer involvement in mental healthcare, and (b) developed into specific questions about how to involve carers in hospital settings, including a discussion of barriers and facilitators to involvement in different clinical procedures. The topic guide was amended after five focus groups, as the questions on hospital procedures and potential interventions were refined following discussions in the initial groups.</p><p>The guide was applied flexibly to enable open discussions within each group. Consequently, although the whole topic guide was covered in each group, different groups discussed some topics more in-depth than others. Participants were asked open-ended questions to stimulate discussions, and all questions were posed as neutrally as possible to encourage them to express their honest opinions. For example, they were asked what they think about the term &#x02018;carer&#x02019; and following this, they were asked to discuss what the helpful and unhelpful aspects might be of involving carers in in-patient treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="other"><title>Analysis</title><p>The focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed using intelligent verbatim and omission of identifiable information, such as names. The analysis was conducted independently of the linked study,<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> which had focused on the practicalities of barriers and facilitators to carer involvement in in-patient treatment. NVivo software was used for coding and organising data during the analysis. Interim analysis was conducted by J.K. and A.D. after nine focus groups and a decision was made to continue with recruitment. After 16 focus groups, J.K., A.D. and D.G. had a reflective discussion about whether saturation of themes had been reached, and it was decided to cease recruitment.</p><p>Inductive thematic analysis<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> was used to analyse the transcripts. This involved looking for common themes and exploring whether there are any similarities and differences between the participant groups. The stages included initial familiarisation with the data corpus by reading all transcripts. Initial coding of the transcripts was then conducted for all transcripts with the research question in mind. Distinct areas of exploration were then identified through the initial coding, and further analysis was conducted within the framework of two domains: (a) what a &#x02018;carer&#x02019; is, and (b) how the &#x02018;carer&#x02019; role is described within the context of the hospital environment.</p><p>An iterative process of identifying subthemes through reflective discussions was conducted throughout the analysis. Labels were attached to each quote during the coding process to identify whether it came from a patient, carer or clinician. Comparisons between the three participant groups were then made at later stages of analysis, once initial themes had been formed. Clusters of related subthemes were converted to overarching themes, with transcripts and quotes being re-checked to ensure consistency of the themes. For example, initial coding of quotes describing &#x02018;battles&#x02019; were further analysed to understand which aspect of the hospital context and/or procedures was resulting in this perception, and what this meant in terms of being a &#x02018;carer&#x02019;. Largely, these quotes described how carers were perceived by professionals as being &#x02018;difficult&#x02019; and there were several examples from different participant groups to support this view. These quotes were placed into themes after the transcripts were checked for alternative views. After finalising the themes, quotes were extracted for the article for transparency and to illustrate the findings, although some demographic information was changed to preserve anonymity.</p><p>All transcripts were independently coded and analysed by A.D., a researcher with a primary interest in patient perspectives on family involvement and J.K., a researcher with interests in sociocultural perspectives on mental health. The findings were discussed and agreed with a third researcher (D.G.), an academic and clinical psychiatrist who had also conducted some of the focus groups and was familiar with the transcripts. These backgrounds may have influenced each author's personal interpretation of the themes. However, efforts were made to maximise the rigour and trustworthiness of the analysis process by analysing the transcripts separately and then having multiple reflective discussions on the development of the themes. Any points of disagreement were discussed and the transcripts were re-checked throughout the analysis process before deciding on the final themes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3-1" sec-type="other"><title>Participants</title><p>Eighty-six participants attended 16 focus groups held between 2014 and 2016.

Unless otherwise specified, the themes appeared in all three participant types: patients, carers and clinicians. The Appendix contains a summary of the themes and subthemes within these two domains.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3" sec-type="other"><title>Domain one: who or what is a carer?</title><p>It was difficult to find a universally acceptable term for a &#x02018;carer&#x02019;, as there was diversity in participants&#x02019; perceptions of what a &#x02018;carer&#x02019; does. To some extent, caring could be seen as an every day part of human relationships. Some carers felt it did not need a label or further recognition, and so they preferred to use everyday terms such as &#x02018;mother&#x02019; or &#x02018;father&#x02019; instead. However, some carers viewed the caring role as something that is defined by going beyond what a family member would already do. The term &#x02018;carer&#x02019; therefore was seen as a title that recognises this. Some clinicians saw it as more of a service term, used between staff only:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Like, I would never say, &#x0201c;This is so-and-so's carer&#x0201d; in front of the person.&#x02019; (Clinician 32)</p><p>&#x02018;No, of course not.&#x02019; (Clinician 31)</p></disp-quote></p><sec id="sec3-3-1" sec-type="other"><title>Caring in mental health is distinct from physical health</title><p>Participants noted how &#x02018;with mental health patients&#x02026;every bit counts, no matter how small or big&#x02019; (Clinician 22) and often, the support was not always clearly defined, but involved &#x02018;being with&#x02019; the person. Carers used words like &#x02018;sitting&#x02019; &#x02018;minding&#x02019; and &#x02018;monitoring&#x02019;. Through this they said how there was an element of &#x02018;experiencing with&#x02019; the person when one is a carer. This was seen as unique to mental health. Participants also described how carers do what staff cannot or do not do. Many participants felt that carers should be rewarded for reducing the pressure on services and for providing the support that nobody else could.</p><p>Furthermore, caring in mental health was described as different to physical health in terms of how it &#x02018;crept up&#x02019; on people, and one became a carer &#x02018;gradually&#x02019;, &#x02018;without noticing&#x02019;. It was a &#x02018;job with no end date&#x02019; because the unique nature of the support meant that there was so much uncertainty in the process. It was also felt that carers had little choice in the process. One patient felt that their family being forced to care was akin to a &#x02018;form of slavery&#x02019; (Patient 21).
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Sometimes you could be caring for somebody for such a long time, you don't even know when you started, or when you stopped so to say, &#x0201c;now you're a carer&#x0201d;, it doesn't work like that.&#x02019; (Carer 14)</p><p>&#x02018;Some people don't want to care and they're in a carer role.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;You would use it if you have been yeah, in in mental health services for, you know, quite some time or your relative had an illness that was prolonged for months and months or years then you become a carer but it's not really something in an acute setting.&#x02019; (Clinician 5)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Similarly, patients often felt they only had a &#x02018;carer&#x02019; when they were unwell, as their fluctuating mental and emotional states meant they experienced fluctuating levels of need. This left carers in the position of always needing to be available but not knowing when their involvement would be welcomed or rejected.
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Well &#x0201c;carer&#x0201d; is to me like&#x000a0;&#x02026;&#x000a0;you're still not well. You're still being cared for. I mean I'm at a stage within my recovery where, I'm not being cared for. I'm caring for myself. So I'm my care &#x02013; they're just people who are there to help me when I do start falling back and so to me they're not carers, they're support.&#x02019; (Patient 24)</p><p>&#x02018;He [previously] referred to me as a carer, yes, but now where he feels that he's on the road of recovery, he feels that I'm not caring for him as much. But, I am caring for him in what I'm doing for him. I do care for him&#x000a0;&#x02026;I'm having to be the one that has to access the services.

One referred to their role as a &#x02018;mind-minder&#x02019;. Some clinicians also described how they felt carers were the ones who had to &#x02018;deal with it 24/7&#x02019; and &#x02018;day in, day out&#x02019;.

Many clinicians and some patients expressed discomfort with the idea of a patient being dependent on a carer.
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Err it's yeah it kind of implies a bit of feebleness about someone who needs the one cared for long time which isn't necessarily the case and isn't what we're aiming for.&#x02019; (Clinician 16)</p><p>&#x02018;A lot of us have evolved from&#x000a0;&#x02026; I mean, there are probably nurses that do, but most people have moved away from that kind of&#x000a0;&#x02026; You've got a mental health problem, so you are obviously rubbish, you can't do anything, so you must have a carer, kind of thing.&#x02019; (Clinician 28)</p><p>&#x02018;But then I think there's also the other side maybe &#x0201c;carer&#x0201d; like you can't do anything for yourself&#x000a0;&#x02026;&#x000a0;you're helpless.&#x02019; (Patient 7)</p></disp-quote>Others viewed dependency differently. They were comfortable with the idea that there might be a temporary period where someone has lost their independence and needs support to look after themselves again. This was often described as a major point of contention with staff.

It's like they're babies again [Carer 7: &#x02018;yeah yeah&#x02019;] but while we're talking to the doctors and people they don't get it [Carer 7: &#x02018;no&#x02019;] because they just think &#x0201c;he's a big geezer&#x000a0;&#x02026;&#x000a0;a big bloke&#x0201d; [Carer 7: &#x02018;mm&#x02019;].&#x02019; (Carer 8)</p></disp-quote>Although (as above) some clinicians expressed discomfort about disempowering overtones, many carers saw irony in this, as the nature of an involuntary hospital admission itself was viewed as paternalistic by some.

This jarred with the idea of calling someone a &#x02018;carer&#x02019;, as they might be implicated in the person's mental health problems by &#x02018;adding to the stress&#x02019; (Clinician 2).

This was especially the case during the admission process, which was described as &#x02018;a traumatic and chaotic experience for all the involved&#x02019; (Clinician 10). During this time, family and friends could be an &#x02018;invaluable&#x02019; source of comfort for patients, although this was also a time when both patients and carers were more likely to feel traumatised and in need of information to alleviate concerns. Clinicians described how carers might find it &#x02018;distressing&#x02019; to view their relative being restrained or very heavily medicated. For this reason, they sometimes preferred to keep carers away to prevent them from witnessing upsetting scenes. Carers recounted the reassuring impact of &#x02018;very calm staff&#x02019; during these times.
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;I was terrified.&#x02019; (Patient 25)</p><p>&#x02018;You're scared of the whole situation, so you don't really talk to anyone, you &#x02013; you don't wanna talk to staff, &#x02018;cause it's a frightening experience and it takes a while before you can actual feel settled enough to talk to people and&#x02026;if your carer is someone that's spent a lot of time with you, they know how you are, so you're possibly gonna open up more to them.&#x02019; (Patient 24)</p><p>&#x02018;Especially when it's your first time.

Ward rounds were viewed by many participants as the main way families can be involved but also the greatest source of difficulty. Carers described them as inflexible and a source of uncertainty and stress. As most important decisions were made there, carers considered consultant psychiatrists to be the most important people to work with. However, clinicians noted that it is the consultants that often have little time to spend with individual patients and carers.

This placed carers&#x02019; role on the periphery, as they were often not seen as a core part of the patient's care or the clinical team's routine procedures. Working with carers was seen as a resource-intensive add-on service that was difficult to provide.

Related to this, many carers described the hospital as a place of &#x02018;battle&#x02019; that was &#x02018;daunting&#x02019; and where they had to &#x02018;fight&#x02019; and be &#x02018;pushy&#x02019; to be included.

<disp-quote><p>&#x02018;Who we care for, our loved ones, they don't realise what we have to go through when confronting professionals.

Carers often felt &#x02018;invisible&#x02019; on the ward and excluded from ward procedures through omission. Unlike the previous theme, not engaging with carers was not necessarily because of intentional exclusion, but because clinicians were unable to see how their role could support carers. This also related to the non-systemic nature of many hospitals, where the main focus of treatment decisions were regarding the patient's symptoms and their medication. Carers were described as having at most a peripheral role in these procedures.

We found some agreement on the types of support carers provide for patients. However, there were differences in opinion between the different stakeholder groups about when someone can be said to be providing care and the point at which someone can &#x02018;justifiably&#x02019; be called a carer. Additionally, the hospital setting was seen as both directly and indirectly precluding the involvement of carers. The set-up of the service placed carers in one of three positions: supportive experts that provide collateral information, &#x02018;troublemakers&#x02019; who get in the way of ward procedures and, perhaps the most difficult, &#x02018;invisibles&#x02019;, people who may spend substantial time on the ward but whom staff do not always know how to include in their routine procedures.</p><p>There were also multiple differences in opinion regarding the carer role, which might explain why carers often fell into these allocated roles. There was clear disagreement about what constitutes caring and unhelpful behaviour, as was demonstrated in the varying attitudes toward dependency. What some saw as providing essential care, others saw as an impediment to recovery. What emerged was that discomfort with the idea of dependency is not necessarily a universal. Although staff wanted to protect patients from &#x02018;overwhelm&#x02019;, many patients saw the solution to poor relationships with carers as increased involvement, so they have a better understanding of mental health and can support them more appropriately.</p><p>Additionally, although formal definitions of &#x02018;carer&#x02019; exist, in reality, there were vast differences in labelling. Family members felt their caring role was all-encompassing in nature, whereas patients and clinicians did not often share this view, and had various personal definitions for when someone can rightly be called a &#x02018;carer&#x02019;. The disagreement about whether being a &#x02018;carer&#x02019; is a constant state, or if it has to be &#x02018;earned&#x02019; through caring for someone chronically unwell was linked to mismatched expectations in the clinical setting. It was not always clear if the existence of a &#x02018;carer&#x02019; would be acknowledged or accepted, and if this person would be entitled to inclusion, information and support. However, family members themselves reported a lack of choice about their caring role: it felt simultaneously imposed on them and denied from them.</p><p>Another major complicating factor were the fluctuations of mental and emotional state in patients in acute treatment. Carers were often left unsure as to how welcome they were as patients changed their minds between wanting to include them and not. This was combined with a range of positive and negative reactions from different staff members towards carers, which compounded the uncertain and stressful nature of the overall experience. Many people were left with the impression that hospital is a &#x02018;frightening&#x02019; place or a &#x02018;battleground&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="other"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study sample enabled us to explore and compare the views of patients, carers and clinicians from a variety of roles and settings. The diversity in demographics and experiences helped us to identify common experiences across different settings. One potential limitation was the inclusion of people who self-define as a &#x02018;carer&#x02019;, as they might represent a small proportion of family and friends who are providing support in clinical settings. However, our recruitment strategy included people from a variety of settings beyond carer organisations, such as asking clinicians to share study details with the visitors of people currently in hospital. This ensured that there was diversity among participants in terms of their understanding of the &#x02018;carer&#x02019; role.</p><p>Overall, while focus groups are a good method for generating ideas, they are not ideal for the in-depth exploration of topics. This study may be viewed as a starting point into more in-depth qualitative enquiry into this area, particularly as this field has a lack of patient perspectives. Finally, this study mainly focused on in-patient treatment, and there might be other complicating factors that have an impact on peoples&#x02019; experiences in other settings. Further discussion of strengths and limitations may be found in our linked article.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec4-3" sec-type="other"><title>Interpretation and comparison with literature</title><p>Previous literature highlights the difficulties experienced by families in the clinical setting. Jankovic and colleagues mapped out carers&#x02019; experiences and found that difficulties begin to arise long before reaching the hospital admission stage.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This might explain some of the discrepancies in participant views on when someone can be called a &#x02018;carer&#x02019;. For carers, the less visible process of monitoring to prevent relapse might be experienced as a constant state, not just confined to when the person is unwell. Furthermore, the process leading to admission is often described as traumatic for the family members themselves, resulting in them needing higher levels of information and reassurance, but being unsure if they will receive this, or face exclusion or invisibility.</p><p>Studies of carer perspectives describe how they feel that confidentiality is used by clinicians as a reason to exclude them in in-patient settings.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Wilkinson &#x00026; McAndrew describe families&#x02019; feelings of powerlessness that can arise from being excluded and feeling invisible in in-patient settings.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> By including clinicians and patients themselves in these focus groups, we demonstrate some of the reasons why carers might be excluded beyond the desire to protect patient confidentiality. In some cases, there appears to be a fundamental clash of values in terms of what is best for the patient. The patient voice itself, however, is not always included in these decisions, as illustrated by examples of family members being excluded to protect patients from overwhelm or because the carer disagrees with the treatment plan.</p><p>Each type of exclusion requires a different approach to address it. Intentional exclusion might be avoided through increased communication at the outset. This might include efforts to find common goals and values during the treatment process, or by addressing families&#x02019; underlying needs for acknowledgement and reassurance. However, unintentionally leaving families out due to not considering them as central to ward procedures might be a more difficult, systemic issue to address.</p><p>The hospital setting being a barrier in itself is usually discussed in terms of the individualistic, non-systemic nature of the setting.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Our study specifies some of the most difficult aspects, and why it may be such a challenge to overcome them. The centrality and time-limited nature of ward rounds, for example, emerged as a frustration for all stakeholders. Our linked studies specify some of the practicalities of what could be done to overcome some of these organisational barriers.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Frameworks such as the Triangle of Care<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> or intervention models such as SYMPA (systems therapy in acute psychiatry)<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> or Family Intervention<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> can also provide some structure and guidance to this process.</p><p>Finally, Landeweer and colleagues highlight differences in what patients, carers and clinicians view to be barriers to family involvement. They suggest these discrepancies are the result of differences in their underlying beliefs and values.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This study illustrates that indeed, even the definition of &#x02018;carer&#x02019; is not necessarily agreed among all stakeholders. The reasons for this might be because of different motivations and belief systems about what mental health is and what treatment should entail.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> While all parties might view the patient's independence as the ultimate aim, the route to this and the speed at which it happens might not be universally agreed, resulting in conflict in the acute setting.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-4" sec-type="other"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>The role of families in hospital settings is not universally agreed. They can present a variety of needs ranging from basic information, emotional support or collaboration to support the patient's treatment. This can pose difficulties for clinicians, who describe the conflict of having to attend to the individual patient while trying to best manage the needs of carers. This is dealt with in different ways, as some choose to work more closely with families and others exclude them from ward procedures. Families therefore face strong uncertainty in the in-patient process, not knowing if they will be welcomed, supported, ignored or excluded.</p><p>A further complicating factor emerged that not all clinicians viewed family members as carers and did not see it as their role to include them in clinical procedures. This may be related to what the fundamental purpose of a hospital is perceived to be. If it is solely to attend to the presenting symptoms of a patient, the presence of additional family members will indeed be seen as a hindrance to ward procedures. If a broader, systemic view is taken, those same family members might be conceptualised as major members of the patient's social network, whose presence can be beneficial, whether they are &#x02018;carers&#x02019; or not. In reality, many clinicians placed themselves somewhere between both of these views, depending on the &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; and &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; service they could provide on a given day. However, this inconsistent approach might compound the high level of uncertainty already present in this setting. Structured procedures to routinely identify and support carers might alleviate some of the difficulties described above.</p><p>Additionally, as acknowledged by all three participant groups, patient choice is important, but it does not preclude meaningful interactions with carers. Although it must be acknowledged that many ward procedures and confidentiality rules are not set-up to favour carer involvement, positive examples of other ways of engaging carers demonstrated that it is still possible to improve upon patient, carer and clinician experiences in the in-patient setting.</p><p>Overall, this study highlights the importance of clarity when considering the &#x02018;carer&#x02019; role, as misunderstandings can have the potential to have a negative impact on patient, family and staff experiences. As demonstrated by participant examples, excluding carers might appear to help clinical procedures in the short term, but could create more divisions between patients, carers and clinicians in the long term. Establishing wishes and expectations at the beginning of admission might be one way of opening up the potential for communication and reducing the likelihood that a patient or carer feels they have not been listened to. Finally, giving clinicians the space to have open conversations and critically reflect on core fundamentals such as the role of carers in their work might help them to problem-solve, and decide how to adapt their approach to carer involvement within their own local context.</p><p>In conclusion, there is no single agreed definition of &#x02018;carer&#x02019;. This conflict in how a carer is viewed has the potential to have a major impact on their experience in in-patient settings. The implementation of carer involvement initiatives should incorporate addressing this fundamental aspect. Overall, it could be concluded that there needs to be clearer agreement about the role of carers in hospital settings, as they fluctuate between being perceived of as important resources, passive visitors or adversaries.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="sec-das" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All authors had access to the study data for the duration of data collection and analysis.
