:Abstract:
   Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is vital for developing novel
   treatments. Attempts to identify the intermediate state between
   normal cognition and dementia have evolved over the past 50 years.
   Current taxonomies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be
   criticised for their imprecise operationalisation. With the advent of
   biomarkers such as amyloid-beta positron emission tomography imaging
   in established Alzheimer's disease, much research has focused on
   establishing which factors predict progression from MCI to
   Alzheimer's disease dementia. In this review, we discuss the
   historical context of MCI before reviewing the literature of MCI
   subtypes and their risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease
   dementia. Finally, we summarise the literature and discuss
   limitations and weaknesses of how the construct is operationalised
   and implemented, before offering suggestions for development of the
   concept of MCI. We conclude that MCI must be empirically defined for
   the sake of its predictive validity to identify Alzheimer's disease
   before dementia develops.

Dementia (in this review, we will use the term dementia because of its
ubiquity, the fact that it is still used by ICD-10 and historically many
studies have used the term dementia), now also known as major
neurocognitive disorder,\ :sup:`1` is a common clinical syndrome that is
characterised by progressive cognitive impairment that is severe enough
significantly to impair daily functioning.\ :sup:`2` Much research
effort has been directed towards Alzheimer's disease, which is the most
common cause of dementia.\ :sup:`3,4` Despite its tremendous burden, no
disease modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease are
available.\ :sup:`5,6`

The dominant theory of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology implies that
amyloid-beta (Aβ) is central to the upstream mechanism of
disease.\ :sup:`7` Recent trials with monoclonal antibodies against Aβ,
such as solanezumab, have proved unsuccessful in mild to moderate
Alzheimer's disease dementia\ :sup:`8` and in mild Alzheimer's disease
dementia,\ :sup:`9` although the negative results may relate to the late
disease stage at which the treatment was applied. With Aβ deposited in
the brain for over 20 years before the development of the clinical
syndrome of Alzheimer's disease dementia,\ :sup:`10` early recognition
will be key to developing potential disease-modifying therapies and
secondary prevention, as well as making lifestyle and medico-legal
decisions while cognitive faculties are still sufficiently intact.

Efforts to identify early or even pre-dementia patients with some very
mild degree of impairment have been underway for over 50
years,\ :sup:`11` and this thinking has evolved through several
iterations to arrive at the current term of mild cognitive impairment
(MCI).\ :sup:`12` The concept of MCI has several similar but importantly
different definitions and taxonomies, which will now be discussed
systematically.

The review begins with a background consideration of Alzheimer's disease
and an historical overview of MCI. This will be followed by a systematic
review of the literature comparing the various taxonomies in their
usefulness in predicting progression from MCI to Alzheimer's disease
dementia. Finally, we discuss the state of the current literature and
its limitations with a view to early identification of Alzheimer's
disease to allow the testing of novel putative disease-modifying
treatments.

Alzheimer's disease
===================

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is
the most common cause of dementia, accounting for approximately 50–70%
of cases.\ :sup:`13–17` Its clinical hallmark is impairment of memory
and new learning with rapid forgetting of newly learned
information.\ :sup:`18` Diagnostic criteria emphasise impairment of
memory with insidious onset and gradual progression, as well as
impairment of at least one other cognitive domain, which are severe
enough to impair functional abilities significantly.\ :sup:`1,18–21` The
most recent iteration of the DSM has adopted the term ‘major
neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease’, while retaining the
essential diagnostic criteria.\ :sup:`1`

.. _sec1-2:

Mild cognitive impairment
=========================

MCI is an intermediate state between cognitively intact persons and
those with dementia. This concept has evolved over time with various
taxonomies, nomenclatures and definitions, which are summarised in
`Table 1 <#tab01>`__ and described in an historical context below. Table

Historical development
----------------------

The concept of pre-dementia causing subsyndromal symptoms was described
as early as 1962, when Kral\ :sup:`11` described ‘benign senescent
forgetfulness’. This encompassed mild fluctuating retrieval-based memory
impairment, which he speculated could be a mild early form of senile
atrophy that spared the Papez\ :sup:`22` circuit. A shortcoming of
Kral's description was that it lacked operational criteria, which can
impede diagnostic reliability.\ :sup:`23`

Over 20 years later, Kral's concept was extended and operationalised by
Crook and colleagues; they labelled their concept age-associated memory
impairment (AAMI), which they defined as subjective memory complaint and
objective memory impairment on a memory test at least one standard
deviation below the mean for young adults.\ :sup:`24` By using healthy
young adults as a reference sample, this definition lacked specificity,
given that performance on psychometric tasks of memory declines with
healthy ageing\ :sup:`25–27` and up to 90% of elderly individuals would
fulfil this criterion.\ :sup:`28` A further criticism was that AAMI
exclusively focused on memory, although other cognitive domains, such as
visuospatial abilities, language or executive functions, may be affected
principally early in Alzheimer's disease.\ :sup:`29,30`

Addressing both of these criticisms, the International Psychogeriatric
Association broadened the concept to include other cognitive domains and
also defined objective impairment with reference to an age-matched
sample.\ :sup:`31` They labelled this age-associated cognitive decline
(AACD), defined as subjective cognitive decline as observed by the
individual or an informant; gradual decline over at least 6 months; and
impairment in a cognitive domain with performance one standard deviation
below the mean of an age- and education-matched normative
sample.\ :sup:`31` AAMI and AACD appear to be distinct clinical entities
with only approximately 50% overlap in concordant diagnosis and AACD
participants showing more extensive cognitive impairment.\ :sup:`32`

The term ‘MCI’ was first described by Reisberg and colleagues with the
development of the Global Deterioration Scale.\ :sup:`33` This was a
seven-point ordinal scale from ‘no cognitive decline’ to ‘severe
dementia’ that defined MCI as one or more of several examples of
cognitive lapse such as becoming lost in an unfamiliar location,
word-finding difficulty, forgetting names or misplacing objects, or as
concentration deficit with clinical testing.\ :sup:`33`

Concurrently, the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale was
developed,\ :sup:`34` which was also an ordinal scale ranging from ‘no
impairment’ to ‘severe dementia’. Although not directly referring to
MCI, the CDR introduced the importance of daily functioning into the
concept. A person scoring 0.5 or ‘questionable impairment’ on the CDR
may have slight impairment of community affairs or home life but would
be fully independent with self-care.\ :sup:`34` Flicker and colleagues
used the term ‘MCI’ when they showed that psychometric impairment at
baseline could predict subsequent decline in elderly patients after 2
years.\ :sup:`35`

Ronald Petersen, a major developer of the concept of MCI through the
Mayo clinic, developed his original definition of MCI based on patients
recruited from a community-based medical clinic.\ :sup:`36` They
identified people who were themselves concerned about their cognition,
or whose carers or physicians were concerned. These patients then had an
extensive battery of physical examination, cognitive assessment,
investigations and neuroimaging to rule out dementia as determined by
expert panel consensus. These patients by definition had ‘normal’ scores
on the Mini-Mental State Examination\ :sup:`37` and Short Test of Mental
Status.\ :sup:`38` Petersen and colleagues (1995) observed that this
cohort tended to perform 1.5 standard deviations below the age-matched
mean performance on memory tasks such as auditory verbal learning tests,
and activities of daily living (ADL) were generally preserved,
corresponding to a CDR rating of 0.5. By employing age-corrected, but
not education-corrected, normative data, it introduced confounding
difficulties with patients with low education or low IQ.

These criteria were more formally proposed and became known as the Mayo
Clinic core criteria or the Petersen criteria.\ :sup:`39` The criteria
were restricted to memory impairment rather than impairment of other
cognitive domains, and thus were subject to similar criticism to that of
AAMI; that Alzheimer's disease may principally affect other cognitive
domains.\ :sup:`29` In 2003, a key symposium of experts revised the Mayo
Clinic criteria to include domains other than memory.\ :sup:`12`
Referred to as the Winblad criteria, these defined MCI as: (a) the
person is neither normal nor demented; (b) there is evidence of
cognitive deterioration shown by either objectively measured decline
over time and/or subjective report of decline by self and/or informant
in conjunction with objective cognitive deficits; and (3) ADL are
preserved and complex instrumental functions are either intact or
minimally impaired.\ :sup:`12` Subcategories of MCI were established
based on the pattern of cognitive domains affected: amnestic
single-domain, amnestic multiple-domain, non-amnestic single-domain and
non-amnestic multiple-domain.\ :sup:`40`

The concept of ‘cognitive impairment, no dementia’ (CIND) was introduced
in the context of the need for early recognition of dementia.\ :sup:`41`
CIND was identified on the basis of a consensus conference of physician,
nurse and neuropsychologist, integrating all available information from
clinical and psychometric assessment.\ :sup:`42` It includes individuals
with non-dementia-related aetiologies such as delirium, chronic alcohol
and drug use, depression, psychiatric illness, intellectual disability
and circumscribed memory impairment; this results in high prevalence
estimates\ :sup:`41` and many CIND individuals will not develop
dementia. A criticism of CIND is that it does not provide operational
criteria, which may jeopardise its reliability.

.. _sec1-2-2:

Recent definitions and developments
-----------------------------------

In the context of emerging biomarkers, the National Institute on Aging
and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) convened a workgroup to revise
the diagnostic criteria for pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease.\ :sup:`43`
Not long thereafter, the DSM-5\ :sup:`1` abandoned the term ‘dementia’
and replaced it with ‘major neurocognitive disorder’, while adding the
term ‘mild neurocognitive disorder’ (mNCD), which has similarities to
MCI including cognitive complaint, psychometric impairment and relative
preservation of ADL.

The NIA-AA and DSM-5 mNCD both refrained from offering a strict cut-off
score for psychometric impairment, instead suggesting that typical
levels of impairment would be 1–2 or 1–1.5 standard deviations below the
mean, respectively, for age- and education-matched normative data.
Instead of arbitrary cut-offs, these criteria advocated for an
individualised assessment that incorporated all available evidence.

The NIA-AA criteria\ :sup:`43` combined core clinical criteria with
clinical research criteria, which incorporated biomarker evidence of
disease. In doing so, these criteria moved beyond MCI as a pre-clinical
definition incorporating history and examination findings to a prodromal
state with biological evidence of incipient disease. The NIA-AA
workgroup explicitly focused on MCI due to Alzheimer's disease and used
biomarkers to stratify the likelihood that the cognitive change is due
to Alzheimer's disease. Biomarkers indicating a high likelihood that MCI
is due to Alzheimer's disease are an abnormal Aβ marker (e.g. positive
PiB (Pittsburgh compound B) scan or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Aβ\ :sub:`42`) and a positive biomarker of neuronal injury (e.g. CSF
tau, FDG-PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography) or
structural magnetic resonance imaging). MCI unlikely to be due to
Alzheimer's disease is determined when Aβ markers and markers of
neuronal injury are both negative. MCI due to Alzheimer's disease with
intermediate likelihood has either Aβ markers or neuronal injury markers
as abnormal, while the other is untested. Recent studies suggest this
taxonomy is useful in predicting Alzheimer's disease.\ :sup:`44,45`
However, the invasiveness, cost and availability of these biomarkers may
limit their widespread implementation in clinical settings.

Subjective cognitive decline is incorporated into modern definitions of
MCI.\ :sup:`1,12,24,31,36,43` MCI may be preceded by a state in which
the individual experiences subjective cognitive decline that is too
subtle to be detected on psychometric testing.\ :sup:`46` The Subjective
Cognitive Decline Initiative working party have conceptualised this as a
pre-MCI state on the same spectrum towards Alzheimer's disease dementia
and provided definitions\ :sup:`46` that have been operationalised for
research purposes.\ :sup:`47`

.. _sec1-2-3:

Prevalence of MCI
-----------------

Since their publication, the revised Mayo clinic criteria\ :sup:`12`
have been commonly adopted in the literature, and studies reported in
this section used these criteria unless otherwise stated.

Prospective population-based studies show that the prevalence of MCI
ranges from 15 to 22% in elderly individuals.\ :sup:`48,49` Prevalence
increases with age, decreases with education, and is more common in
males, unmarried people and carriers of the APOE-ε4
allele.\ :sup:`49,50` Prospective population-based studies have
estimated incidence rates of around 6% per year, although the rate in
men (over 7%) was slightly higher than that in women (under
6%).\ :sup:`51`

.. _sec1-2-4:

Progression of MCI to dementia
------------------------------

Estimates of progression rates to dementia or Alzheimer's disease
dementia are important for advising patients about prognosis and have
implications for conducting research in this population. Individuals
with MCI have a higher risk of developing dementia compared with the
general older population incidence of 1–2% per year,\ :sup:`52` although
estimates vary depending on the definition or subtype of MCI, study
design and follow-up period.\ :sup:`52–55` Earlier definitions using the
Petersen amnestic-only MCI criteria estimated rates of progression to
Alzheimer's disease dementia to be 10–15% per year.\ :sup:`52` A
randomised controlled trial reported a progression rate of 16% per
year.\ :sup:`55` A meta-analysis of studies using Mayo clinic criteria
for MCI suggested that over 10 years, 33.6% will cumulatively progress
to Alzheimer's disease dementia in specialist settings versus 28.9% in
population settings, which translated to an annual progression rate of
8.1% in specialist settings and 6.8% in community studies.\ :sup:`56`

There is some criticism of the utility of MCI as a diagnosis given its
heterogenous nosology,\ :sup:`57` variable prognostic
significance\ :sup:`58–60` and the various ethical issues it
raises.\ :sup:`57` We would counterargue that these issue provide
impetus to refine the definition of MCI, as doing so will allow
identification of a group that could be identified for treatment of
modifiable risk factors that may decrease the risk of developing
dementia, such as diet, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia.\ :sup:`61,62`

The present study aimed to review the evidence with regards to which
taxonomy of MCI was more useful in predicting incident Alzheimer's
disease dementia. We hypothesised that amnestic MCI (aMCI) and
multiple-domain MCI would be more likely than non-MCI controls to
progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia.

MCI subtype and progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia
-----------------------------------------------------------

Only a single study explicitly examined differences between various
classification systems of MCI and progression to Alzheimer's disease
dementia. In a large population-based study of 4057 individuals with 4.5
years follow-up, DSM-5 criteria gave a higher annual progression rate
than Petersen criteria for progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia
and to all-cause dementia.\ :sup:`66` However, the majority of people
who developed Alzheimer's disease dementia were classified as normal
controls at baseline. The DSM-5 criteria were more restrictive, with
only 139 cases meeting criteria, whereas 303 cases met criteria for
Petersen aMCI. The authors do not stipulate why, but a possible
contributing factor to this is that the DSM-5 criteria explicitly
exclude people with severe depression, psychosis or delirium, whereas
the Petersen criteria do not. Marcos and colleagues (2016) noted that
most of the MCI cases did not progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia
or dementia during the 4.5-year follow-up; indeed, only 15% of the DSM-5
defined MCI cases progressed to dementia.

Twelve studies explicitly examined differences between various subtypes
of MCI, usually within the Winblad taxonomy.\ :sup:`12` The most
consistent finding was that aMCI is associated with an increased risk of
progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia.\ :sup:`53,67–77`
Individuals with aMCI are more likely (18–19% per year) to progress to
Alzheimer's disease dementia than non-amnestic MCI participants (10–11%)
in community-:sup:`53` and healthcare-based cohorts.\ :sup:`78`

Ten studies compared progression rates between various subtypes within
the Winblad taxonomy. Seven of these studies show that multiple-domain
aMCI has the best predictive accuracy for progression to Alzheimer's
disease dementia,\ :sup:`54,67–69,73,74,76` with annual progression
rates ranging from 4 to 25%. However, two studies found that
single-domain aMCI was associated with the highest risk of progression
to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease,\ :sup:`70,77` and one found no
difference between single- and multiple-domain aMCI.\ :sup:`71` A
challenge to the discriminative validity of the Winblad taxonomy is that
multiple-domain aMCI was also the best predictor of progression to
vascular dementia.\ :sup:`73`

Although all studies purported to employ the revised Mayo criteria,
these were operationalised in different ways, for example, using
hierarchical cluster analysis of neuropsychological data rather than
clinical judgement\ :sup:`70` or not including information about
subjective memory complaint.\ :sup:`67` Moreover, psychometric
impairment was defined in one study as at least 1.5 standard deviations
below the mean for an age- and education-matched sample on a
neuropsychological battery\ :sup:`77` or as at least 1.0 standard
deviations below the mean for an age- and education-matched sample on
indices derived from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.\ :sup:`68`

.. _sec4:

Discussion
==========

The concept of MCI has evolved from a vague clinical observation to a
diagnosis that can incorporate disease biomarkers to predict the
likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia. There have been
at least nine different attempts to define the intermediate state
between cognitive health and dementia. However, only a single study has
explicitly compared different taxonomies in terms of their usefulness in
predicting incident Alzheimer's disease dementia.\ :sup:`66` This study
showed that DSM-5-defined mNCD had better positive predictive value than
did Petersen criteria, although the majority of people who developed
Alzheimer's disease dementia were classified as normal controls at
baseline. Of the studies comparing various subtypes of MCI within the
Winblad taxonomy, aMCI better predicts progression to Alzheimer's
disease dementia than does non-amnestic MCI.\ :sup:`53,78` This is
consistent with the observation that memory impairment is the hallmark
clinical feature of Alzheimer's disease.\ :sup:`18`

Although there was not consensus, 7 of 10 studies found that
multiple-domain aMCI was better than single domain aMCI in predicting
progression,\ :sup:`54,67–69,73,74,76` two showed the
opposite\ :sup:`70,77` and one showed no difference.\ :sup:`71` A
possible reason for the discrepant findings regarding single-domain aMCI
and multiple-domain aMCI in the prediction of Alzheimer's disease
dementia is differing definitions of the subtypes. The inconsistent
findings within this area highlight the variable implementation of the
criteria. Although all studies purported to employ the revised Mayo
criteria, these were operationalised in different ways, such as not
including subjective memory complaint,\ :sup:`67` different psychometric
cut-off *z-*\ scores ranging from −1.0\ :sup:`68` to −1.5,\ :sup:`77`
different psychometric tests\ :sup:`68,77` or even hierarchical cluster
analysis of neuropsychological data.\ :sup:`70`

This review suggests that aMCI is superior to non-amnestic MCI and that
multiple domain aMCI is probably superior to single domain aMCI in
predicting progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia. It may be that
involvement of cognitive domains in addition to memory in MCI implies
more severe or advanced disease that is closer to the emergence of
dementia. Despite these findings, the predictive validity of MCI is
limited, as up to 60% of MCI individuals will not develop dementia in
the following 10 years.\ :sup:`56`

We suggest that the concept of MCI may be improved in three ways. First,
criteria should be operationally defined. Second, criteria should be
empirically defined. Finally, the MCI group should be stratified for
likelihood of progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia. These will
now be discussed in turn.

Several taxonomies of MCI have suggested explicit cut-off scores on
cognitive measures. Despite this, more recent taxonomies from the DSM-V
and NIA-AA have dispensed with cut-offs for cognitive impairment.
Although this approach has the merit of tailoring assessment to the
individual, it may introduce issues with interrater reliability, which
may further undermine the reliability of MCI in the research literature.
We suggest that criteria for subjective and objective memory impairment
should be operationalised to ensure reliability of the concept.

This raises the question of which cut-off should be adopted. We suggest
that the utility of MCI may be improved by providing operational
criteria that are empirically defined by their prediction of Alzheimer's
disease dementia. There have been only a few attempts to use such
data-driven definitions of MCI. For example, MCI subtypes identified
with latent profile analysis outperformed Winblad criteria\ :sup:`79`.
Other studies have shown that the severity of memory
impairment\ :sup:`80,81` and the base rate of memory
impairment\ :sup:`82` offer an advantage over the common taxonomies. We
propose that cognitive impairment used to identify MCI should be
empirically defined, whether it be in terms of the lowest
performance,\ :sup:`80,81` base rate of impairment,\ :sup:`82` or
possibly average memory score or some other method.

These same factors may then be used to stratify the severity or grade of
MCI. All current taxonomies treat MCI as a categorical entity, which is
not consistent with a longitudinal model of Alzheimer's disease
pathophysiology. Although the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's
disease exists on a spectrum from asymptomatic to severe dementia, MCI
is not staged as such. We propose that MCI should be stratified by
factors such as severity\ :sup:`80,81` or base rate of
impairment\ :sup:`82` to indicate increased risk of progression to
Alzheimer's disease dementia. This may allow individuals to be selected
for more intensive monitoring, for secondary prevention techniques such
as control of diet and cardiovascular risk factors,\ :sup:`61,62` and
for recruitment into clinical trials of putative treatments for
Alzheimer's disease.

Conclusion
==========

The current literature suggests that MCI individuals with memory
impairment and impairment of multiple domains are at increased risk of
progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia. We suggest that the concept
of MCI should be improved by offering operational criteria of memory or
cognitive impairment that are empirically defined. Furthermore, we
propose that MCI should be developed from a singular categorical
diagnosis to a graded diagnosis that indicates increased risk for
progression to Alzheimer's disease dementia. In this way, MCI may become
a more reliable construct with better predictive validity that will be
more useful in understanding the natural history of Alzheimer's disease.
This in turn will allow better targeted selection of individuals with
pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease to allow early implementation of
therapeutic strategies to modify the course of this common and
burdensome disease.
