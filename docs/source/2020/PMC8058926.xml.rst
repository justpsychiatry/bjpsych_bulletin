====================================
Standing with our medical colleagues
====================================

Like many of us I am increasingly concerned about the possible effects
of coronavirus on myself, my family and our community and patients. With
family in Italy, I am mindful of the need there for other medical
professionals to be brought in to work alongside their acute medical
colleagues. This has included those more distant from acute medical work
now, such as pathologists and even in some cases psychiatrists.

Little has been spoken about our role in regards to COVID-19 should we
see similar scenes here in the UK and what our possible involvement
might be. It would be easy to adopt a ‘protectionist’ attitude and leave
the messy stuff to ‘real doctors’.

As a psychiatrist, I am a doctor of the mind and body. Of course, I
would never advocate working beyond our professional competencies;
however, I feel we have a strong duty to stand beside our medical
colleagues be it pushing trolleys, taking blood or sweeping floors if
the need arises. We spend so much time and energy trying to reduce the
splitting that occurs between ‘medicine’ and ‘psychiatry’; surely we
cannot hide behind this very split now when our colleagues and indeed
our communities may need us if an outbreak worsens to the degree that
many fear. Surely then we must stand together as one profession.

None.
