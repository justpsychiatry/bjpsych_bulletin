However, the effects of smoking go far beyond physical health. Research estimates that smokers with mental health conditions could be spending as much as &#x000a3;2200 a year on tobacco, pushing an estimated 130 000 people with a common mental disorder into poverty. The Government has set a target for England to be smokefree by 2030; however, without a dramatic increase in support, smokers with mental health conditions risk being left behind. Action on Smoking and Health provides the secretariat for the Mental Health &#x00026; Smoking Partnership. The Partnership aims to reduce the inequality in smoking rates between people with mental health conditions and the wider population. It brings together Royal Colleges, third-sector organisations, trade unions and academia to review progress and highlight areas for further action.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Smoking</kwd><kwd>poverty</kwd><kwd>inequality</kwd><kwd>physical health</kwd><kwd>education and training</kwd></kwd-group><counts><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="53"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="other" id="sec1"><title>The challenge</title><p>People with mental health conditions die on average 10&#x02013;20 years earlier than individuals in the wider population.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> High smoking rates are one of the key reasons for this health inequality.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Smoking rates remained largely static among people with mental health conditions during the 20 years from 1993 to 2013, at around 40%.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although new figures suggest that this prevalence is starting to decline, smoking rates among people with common mental health conditions remain around 50% higher than those in the wider population.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>However, the effects of smoking go far beyond reduced life expectancy; it influences employment prospects,<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> reduces earnings,<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> increases care needs<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and causes poverty.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Higher smoking rates are associated with every indicator of disadvantage, but most adult smokers want to quit.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Smokers with mental health conditions are aware of the risks to people around them from second-hand smoke and see this as a motivator to quit; clinicians must offer support to enable them to do so.</p><p>The challenge of The Mental Health and Smoking Partnership is to help tackle these inequalities.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The Partnership was established in 2016 following publication of <italic>The Stolen Years: The Mental Health and Smoking Action Report</italic> by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), with the ambition of reducing smoking prevalence to 5% or less among people with mental health conditions.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The report sets out the sector-wide action needed to reduce smoking rates among people with mental health conditions, from reviewing the training of the mental health workforce to building the research base on peer support and expert-by-experience-led interventions.</p><p>Three years on, the Government has published the Tobacco Control Plan for England,<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> NHS Long Term Plan<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and Prevention Green Paper,<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> committing to reducing smoking prevalence among people with mental health conditions.

The fact that in England today people from different socioeconomic groups experience avoidable differences in health, well-being and length of life is, quite simply, unfair and unacceptable&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Half of all lifetime smokers will die from their addiction, that is, more than 96&#x000a0;000 people every year in the UK.

Smoking decreases disposable income (defined as household income after tax and National Insurance contributions), which can be returned to the household when smokers quit. Smokers in social housing spend, on average, 14.6% of their disposable income on tobacco, compared with 6.9% among owner occupiers and 5.8% of those living in privately rented accommodation.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This has substantial economic consequences, with more than 1 million people &#x02013; including 263&#x000a0;000 children &#x02013; living in poverty as a direct result of income lost to expenditure on tobacco. The proportion of social housing tenants living in poverty increases from around a quarter (28.3%) to two in five (42.8%) once the costs of smoking are considered.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Research commissioned by ASH and Public Health England has shown the extent to which people with mental health conditions are economically disadvantaged due to smoking.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Higher rates of smoking are found among people with a mental health condition living in poverty (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

But they can say they've given you some support; the fact that you couldn't use the phone at the time doesn't seem relevant</italic>&#x02019;.</p><p>To reduce the inequality in smoking rates between people with mental health conditions and the wider population, it is essential to improve the support offered in in-patient services. There are examples of trusts leading the way on this agenda, offering excellent support and engaging with smokers to ensure that they are addressing the broader social aspects of smoking and not just physiological withdrawal. Public Health England's videos on implementation of NICE PH48 illustrate some of these examples.<sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> If we are to achieve a smokefree 2030 for people with mental health conditions, these examples must become the norm.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="other"><title>Community services</title><p>A similarly patchy picture of support is seen in community services, which support the majority of people with mental health conditions.<sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Although there is less evidence here, a small-scale, self-selecting survey conducted by ASH of 103 mental health nurses (representing 33 trusts) and 171 psychiatrists (representing 48 trusts) found that over 55% reported receiving no training on supporting smoking cessation.<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Only around a quarter of respondents said that they &#x02018;always&#x02019; or &#x02018;usually&#x02019; delivered very brief advice on smoking.</p><p>Prescribing medications for smoking cessation was reported to be similarly uncommon in community settings. Three-quarters (76%) of qualified nurses said that they never prescribed smoking cessation medications (NRT or varenicline), as did three-fifths (59%) of psychiatrists.<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec5"><title>What works?</title><p>This absence of support is concerning, especially as there is a strong evidence base around what works to support smokers to quit. Smokers are three times more likely to quit successfully with the support of a specialist stop-smoking service than when attempting to quit unaided.<sup><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p>The Smoking Cessation Intervention for People with Severe Mental Ill Health (SCIMITAR) pilot<sup><xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> and randomised controlled trial (SCIMITAR+)<sup><xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> were built on this evidence base. The SCIMITAR trials tailored the support set out in NICE guidance for people with mental health conditions, showing that such an approach is both effective and cost-effective. SCIMITAR compared the effectiveness of combined behavioural and pharmacological support for smoking cessation with usual care.<sup><xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Trial-condition participants received face-to-face behavioural support delivered by a trained mental health professional and prescriptions of their choice of smoking cessation medications, the most commonly chosen being NRT. Adaptations for people with severe mental health conditions &#x02013; including extended pre-quit sessions, &#x02018;cut down to quit&#x02019;, and home visits &#x02013; were offered in the trial arm. Compared with usual care, this intervention more than doubled quit rates at 6-month follow-up and showed significant improvements after 12 months.<sup><xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p><p>Participants in the SCIMITAR trial reported that the intervention being delivered by mental health nurses was important to them. It was important that they felt this support was being delivered by someone who would understand their mental health diagnosis without judgement and with professional expertise.</p><p>An ASH/Rethink focus group participant highlighted clearly the unique part a mental health nurse could play in supporting smokers: &#x02018;<italic>Community mental health nurses visit people in their own homes, and they see how that person is managing. Smoking's expensive &#x02026; if it's the difference between paying your electricity bill and buying a packet of fags&#x02026; If this person is struggling, the community mental health nurse is in a good position to advise and act as a sign-post &#x02026; and link with GP services and the local chemists that offer smoking cessation</italic>&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>This illustrates the value of training mental health professionals to deliver smoking cessation advice and support. However, studies have shown that mental health staff may not see addressing smoking as part of their role. One study found that only 48% of respondents felt that addressing smoking was within their remit as a mental health professional,<sup><xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and one in five were not sure whether quitting smoking would have a positive effect on recovery or thought quitting smoking could have negative effects.<sup><xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup></p><p>The persistence of these myths undermines the potential for mental health services to support smokers to quit, and highlights the need for smoking and smoking cessation to be included in the training of mental health professionals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec6"><title>Making change happen</title><p>Population-level interventions that have driven down smoking rates nationally have largely failed to reach smokers with mental health conditions. Although the specific commitment to supporting people with mental health conditions to stop smoking in the NHS Long Term Plan is welcome, the pace of change is currently slow.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Transformation funding through the NHS Long Term Plan will not be in place nationally until 2023&#x02013;2024.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Although this additional funding and national commitment is welcome, it will not, on its own, help enough smokers with mental health conditions to quit.</p><p>Smoking rates among people with mental health conditions will not reach the national ambition of 5% or less by 2030 without a trained workforce that sees smoking and smoking cessation as part of their role. The current lack of training in smoking cessation among the mental health workforce, as evidenced by trust and community surveys, is a problem that must be tackled if staff are to be able to deliver on these commitments.</p><p>Smokers expect doctors to ask them about smoking and deliver advice. If clinicians are not asking about smoking, it sends the signal that this is nothing to worry about. All psychiatrists should be able to deliver very brief advice, an evidence-based brief intervention on smoking that asks about smoking status, advises that support is available that will increase the chances of successfully stopping, and signposts smokers to further support. This is not designed to support someone through their quit attempt; it is about raising the issue and motivating smokers to try to quit.</p><p>Smokers with mental health conditions are likely to be more heavily addicted and therefore can find quitting harder.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Ensuring that smokers with mental health conditions have access to the right pharmacotherapy to support them to quit is essential. Mental health trusts must ensure that the most effective treatments, including combination NRT and varenicline, are on their formularies and that they are being prescribed to patients in line with NICE guidance.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p><p>Psychiatrists have a key role in reducing smoking among people with mental health conditions and in turn need appropriate training to deliver this. Although people can become immune to statistics about disease and death caused by smoking, reminding them about the effects that smoking has on well-being and quality of life is always worthwhile.</p><p>The number of people with mental health conditions pushed into poverty by smoking demands urgent action. Although quitting smoking will not solve poverty for everyone with a mental health condition, giving people the support they need to quit is a big step in the right direction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec7"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Vicky Salt</bold> is Policy Manager at Action on Smoking and Health, Hatton Garden, UK. <bold>Ciaran Osborne</bold> is Interim Director of Policy, Action on Smoking and Health, Hatton Garden, UK.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Peter Byrne of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p></ack><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>Author contributions</title><p>V.S. led on the writing of this article, with input and review from C.O., who has been overseeing the work of the Mental Health and Smoking Partnership.</p></notes><sec id="nts2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec8"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S2056469420000881sup001"><p>For supplementary material accompanying this paper visit https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.88.</p><media xlink:href="S2056469420000881sup001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d38e837" position="anchor"><caption><p>click here to view supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cite1"><string-name><surname>Chang</surname>
