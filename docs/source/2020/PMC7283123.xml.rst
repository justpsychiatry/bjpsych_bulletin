:Abstract:
   This editorial introduces and reflects on a Praxis article in the
   trainees' section of this issue. The article, 'Assessing asylum
   seekers, refugees and undocumented migrants' by Waterman *et al*,
   begins with a clinical scenario describing an emergency presentation
   at a ‘place of safety’. The authors are to be congratulated for
   navigating a compassionate path through the complexities of law,
   health and new diagnostic categories. The resources found in the
   article, drawing on the principles of trauma-informed care and the
   work of Judith Herman, can help trainees to be more confident in
   promoting the basic rights of survivors of trauma, which might form a
   first step in the re-establishment of trust and empowerment.

There has never been a more timely moment to highlight the needs and
rights of asylum seekers and refugees, as so comprehensively described
in this month's Praxis article ‘Assessing asylum seekers, refugees and
undocumented migrants’, by Waterman *et al*.\ :sup:`1` This population
and those who care for them face many challenges. Not least of these is
the ongoing hostile environment. In the UK, immigration checks are
embedded in everyday interactions and accessing healthcare may result in
sharing of personal data with the Home Office, leading to deportation or
detention.\ :sup:`2` Frequently changing funding arrangements related to
Brexit threaten numerous charities that support migrants.\ :sup:`3`
However, Waterman *et al*'s article can empower us to be hopeful and
compassionate and, importantly, well-versed in relevant law. In so doing
it embraces some of the core values of a psychiatrist as outlined by the
Royal College of Psychiatrists, including advocacy, empowerment and a
person-centred biopsychosocial approach.\ :sup:`4`

The article introduces a fictitious but sadly all too familiar case,
which begins with a presentation in crisis at an inner-city ‘place of
safety’. What I have learned in reviewing this article has already
helped me to advocate for two patients under my care to receive National
Health Service (NHS) treatment and eligibility for housing that was
called into question owing to legal uncertainties. Both had been the
victims of torture and were at varying stages in asylum claims. The
securing of such basic rights is the first step for survivors of trauma
beginning to find safety and regain control over their lives, what
Judith Herman describes as a primary stage in her book *Trauma and
Recovery* (p. 326).\ :sup:`5` However, it would seem that I was not
alone in my ignorance of the complexities of law. A recent survey of a
514 health professionals found that only 26% were aware that all
migrants were entitled to free general practitioner (GP)
services.\ :sup:`6` Just 39% were able to identify which groups of
migrants were entitled to non-emergency NHS care.\ :sup:`6`

Individual and societal responses to trauma
===========================================

In words that still hold true today, Herman wrote in the introduction to
her powerful work: ‘The ordinary response to atrocities is to banish
them from consciousness’.\ :sup:`5` Psychiatry and trauma have a long
and complicated relationship. Trauma has had an often ‘underground’
history, resurfacing and then disappearing at various points depending
on the sociopolitical climate.\ :sup:`7` As far back as 1919 Janet
recognised that the survivors of trauma ‘are unable to make the recital
which we call narrative memory, and yet they remain confronted by [the]
difficult situation’ (Janet 1919: see van der Kolk *et al*\ :sup:`8`).
Years later Kardiner built on Janet's studies of ‘hysteria’ in women to
formulate the outlines of traumatic syndromes in male combat veterans
(Kardiner 1941: see van der Kolk *et al*\ :sup:`8`). Contemporary
psychiatrists such as Herman and van der Kolk have formulated and
communicated clearly and conclusively how traumatic life experiences
have far-reaching effects on the mind and body. This has paved the way
for an understanding of the neurobiological effects of trauma on the
brain, endocrine and immune systems, including dysregulation of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous
hyperarousal.\ :sup:`9` Thanks to Felitti and colleagues’ large and
important study on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), there are now
robust and undeniable links between exposure to trauma and
cardiovascular and respiratory disease, cancer, obesity, chronic pain
and gastrointestinal illness.\ :sup:`9,10` The intergenerational effects
of trauma are also being increasingly understood. It has recently been
found that the children of mothers who were Holocaust survivors and
suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have increased
glucocorticoid sensitivity.\ :sup:`11`

Herman, more than 20 years ago, identified the syndrome of complex
post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD).\ :sup:`12` Yet it has taken
tireless work and campaigning from clinicians, researchers and people
with lived experience for it to now be included in ICD-11.\ :sup:`13`
The operationalisation and recognition of the diagnosis is a significant
step towards research and treatments which acknowledge that prolonged
and repeated trauma profoundly affects the sense of self, affective
stability and relationships. Indeed, some studies have shown that CPTSD
may be even more common that PTSD,\ :sup:`13` and deserves specialist
attention, both within services and also in the educational curricula
for future psychiatrists.

Facing a culture of disbelief
=============================

The article by Waterman and colleagues avoids the scapegoating of
refugees\ :sup:`14` and the ‘denial, repression and dissociation’ of
trauma that Herman identified operating on both societal and individual
levels.\ :sup:`5` Refugees and asylum seekers who are survivors of
trauma encounter multiple challenges, which are described in the
article. First, there is the trauma itself, which is known to cause
‘disintegration of experience’ and loss of narrative.\ :sup:`8` Echoing
Janet's work, Herman describes how ‘people who have survived atrocities
often tell their stories in a highly emotional, contradictory and
fragmented manner’.\ :sup:`5` Yet the processes of accessing healthcare
or asylum demand that survivors tell their story repeatedly, and they
are received by a ‘culture of disbelief’ and face both testimonial and
hermeneutical injustice.\ :sup:`2,15` Individuals who are already
hypervigilant to threat must navigate health services that may share
information with the Home Office, mistakenly charge them for treatment
and inadvertently re-victimise them with unjust, uneducated and
sometimes perverse decisions.\ :sup:`2` Psychiatrist Sandra Bloom
states: ‘because of complex interactions between traumatized clients,
stressed staff, pressured organizations, and a social and economic
environment that is frequently hostile to the aims of recovery, our
systems frequently recapitulate the very experiences that have proven to
be so toxic for the people we are supposed to treat’.\ :sup:`16`

.. _sec3:

Trauma-informed and human rights-based care
===========================================

Trauma-informed care can provide some framework for individuals and
health services and is premised on a fundamental shift from thinking
‘What's wrong with you?’ to ‘What happened to you?’.\ :sup:`17` Such
approaches seek to rebuild trust, create safe environments, empower and
to avoid re-traumatisation.\ :sup:`17`

After reading this Praxis article I would urge trainees to familiarise
themselves with the principles of trauma-informed care and to think how
these might be applied in their organisations. Sweeney and colleagues’
article in *BJPsych Advances* is an extremely helpful
summary.\ :sup:`17` We must also remember that trauma does not occur
only in wars or in other countries; experiences of torture and childhood
adversity are all too common, as highlighted by the original study of
ACEs in the USA.\ :sup:`10` Research in the UK has found a similarly
high frequency, with 47% of almost 4000 participants reporting having
experienced at least one ACE.\ :sup:`18` The pivotal works of
Herman\ :sup:`5` and van der Kolk\ :sup:`19` provide a compelling,
compassionate and eloquent narrative on a subject that is so often
unspeakable. Practical resources and links to specialist agencies for
asylum seekers and refugees can be found as an online supplement to the
Praxis article.\ :sup:`1` Trainees may be interested to explore the
various communities of healthcare professionals who advocate for human
rights-based approaches to healthcare such as Medact
(`www.medact.org/project/migration-health <www.medact.org/project/migration-health>`__),
Docs Not Cops (`www.docsnotcops.co.uk <www.docsnotcops.co.uk>`__) and
the Twitter hashtag #patientsnotpassports. Poetry and storytelling can
also communicate and transform, with the potential to both educate and
liberate from shame and secrecy.

British-Somali poet Warsan Shire writes in her poem ‘Home’:‘no one
leaves home unlesshome is the mouth of a shark.You only run for the
borderwhen you see the whole cityrunning as well.’\ :sup:`20`\ I hope
that Waterman and colleagues’ article offers trainees a framework for
thinking about providing safe and compassionate care to asylum seekers,
refugees and undocumented migrants. I thank the authors for their
perseverance in bringing together complex legislation and issues of
mental and physical healthcare in such a fine example of what we are
seeking in Praxis articles. The article and the work of Herman, van der
Kolk and the principles of trauma-informed care demand us as clinicians,
as fellow humans, to bear witness and to empower survivors. We must
strive to avoid re-traumatisation and rejection, despite the current
hostile environment in which we live and practice.
