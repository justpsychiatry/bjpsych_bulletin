:Abstract:
   The transition from child and adolescent to adult mental health
   services for young people with mental health problems is of
   international concern. Despite the high prevalence of mental
   disorders during adolescence and their tendency to continue during
   adulthood, the majority of young people do not experience continuity
   of care. The aim of this review paper is to unravel the complexity of
   transitional mental healthcare to clinicians, policy makers and
   mental health service managers, and to address challenges to a smooth
   transition process at all levels.

Young people's transition from child and adolescent mental health
services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS) has gained
increasing international interest in recent years. At around the age of
16–18 years, young people with chronic mental health problems are
confronted with two simultaneous transitions: a situational transition
(from CAMHS to AMHS) and a developmental transition (to
adulthood).\ :sup:`1`

Transition is defined as an efficient, planned, patient-oriented process
that meets the medical, psychosocial and educational/occupational needs
of young people with chronic conditions.\ :sup:`2` Additionally, the
developmental perspective is important in conceptualising transition as
young people, those aged 16–24 years, are confronted with changes in
various life domains.\ :sup:`3,4`

The transition age refers to the age at which the care of the young
person in CAMHS is continued in AMHS, and in most cases, concerns young
people in the 16–18 year age range. The following findings linked with
psychopathology are relevant for transitional care at this time point:
first, psychopathology has a high persistence from an early age into
adulthood\ :sup:`5`; second, the onset of many psychopathologies has
been shown to coincide with the transition age.\ :sup:`6,7` Critical
changes in the brain occur during late adolescence, which make this age
group more vulnerable for developing psychopathology.\ :sup:`7`

Moreover, 75% of all psychiatric disorders in adults start before 24
years of age, and 50% before 14 years of age.\ :sup:`8` However, there
is a discord in the pattern of increased risk of psychopathology in
young people and mental health service use.\ :sup:`1,9` Older
adolescents access care far less (28.9%) than 13- to 16-year-olds
(50.9%) or adults over 26 years (41.1%).\ :sup:`10,11` Furthermore, the
gap between CAMHS and AMHS, the so-called ‘transition gap’, results in a
clear discontinuity of care. A sizeable number of youth and young adults
who ‘fall’ in this transition gap access adult services at a later point
in time, when more serious and chronic problems have
developed.\ :sup:`12,13`

The care gap affects not only the young people, but also their families,
communities and society as a whole. Mental health problems are
associated with poorer physical health and poorer functioning in the
social, educational and economic life domains.\ :sup:`14` At the
societal level, the presence of a mental disorder during childhood leads
to a 10-fold higher health cost during adulthood compared with children
without mental health problems.\ :sup:`15` To date, it is unclear what
the real societal impact of the care gap in late adolescence is and to
what extent adequate transitional care reduces this impact.

The aim of this paper is to summarise the new insights and developments
investigated since the review of Singh in 2009.\ :sup:`12` Furthermore,
this paper includes research on youth mental health services and shared
management components, which is one of the limitations of the review of
Paul *et al*.\ :sup:`16`

Continuation of care is a complex process, with important players at the
policy and organisational level, service level and at the level of
individuals: patients, their families and healthcare providers. However,
care discontinuity cannot be explained by only one level.\ :sup:`4,17`
This paper attempts to unravel the complexity of transitional mental
healthcare to clinicians, policy makers and mental health service
managers, and to address challenges to a smooth transition process at
all levels. The advantage of splitting the findings according to the
three levels makes the extensive research regarding transition more
manageable. Furthermore, it emphasises the complexity of the topic, but
also makes clear that solutions are possible at every level.

Challenges regarding transitional mental healthcare
===================================================

.. _sec1-1:

Policy and organisational level
-------------------------------

Improving transitional care has been on the policy agenda in different
European countries for some time now; however, it has been one of a
number of competing priorities. Furthermore, there has been a gap
between policy and implementation in practice, insufficient research
regarding transition, and a lack of transition protocols guiding
transitional care of service providers.\ :sup:`16`

Historically, the way in which mental health services have been
structured, with separate facilities for children/adolescents and adults
is a significant bottleneck to transitional care.\ :sup:`13` Eligibility
thresholds for referral to CAMHS and AMHS often differ; thereby causing
young people to fall through the care gap.\ :sup:`4,18` Furthermore, the
CAMHS-AMHS interface is characterised by different cultural approaches,
a lack of communication and doubts about AMHS staff being proficient in
managing young peoples' care.\ :sup:`19`

Waiting lists form another major barrier in the provision of mental
healthcare to youth and young adults.\ :sup:`20,21` As a result, young
people presenting with a mental health problem at 17 years of age are
often referred directly to AMHS because the waiting time for CAMHS
coincides or exceeds their 18th birthday, i.e. the transition boundary.
Adult services, in turn, hesitate to treat these young people before 18
years of age, because the expertise or the adjusted setting for this
patient group is lacking, or because internal or external regulations
prevent care providers from forming a treatment plan. Young people who
have attended CAMHS but find themselves on a long waiting list for AMHS
– usually with no interim support in place – describe this as highly
anxiety-provoking.\ :sup:`22`

Another challenge is the lack of training requirements for care
providers and variations in the content of training
programmes.\ :sup:`23,24` The knowledge clinicians in either
child/adolescent or adult speciality acquire about young people largely
depends on whether they are provided with adequate training on
psychopathology of adolescents. A lack of confidence amongst mental
health practitioners to work with young people in transition is an area
of concern frequently identified by young people.\ :sup:`22`

Healthcare financing is another policy challenge affecting the care
trajectories of young people. Gaining financial responsibility at the
age of majority can have a real effect on the provision of care in some
countries. Differences in financial benefits for minors versus adults
may relate to the cost of a consultation, the possibility to organise
family therapy or the reimbursement of medication. Some health insurance
policies provide partial reimbursement for therapy sessions for young
people up to 18 years of age, but not for (young) adults. Hence,
although they have reached the age of majority and the ability to
organise their mental healthcare independently, young people often still
remain financially dependent on their parents to pay for their care. If
there is a serious disruption in the parent–child relationship, the
continuation of care at a new mental health service may be in jeopardy.

.. _sec1-2:

Service level
-------------

Different treatment approaches at CAMHS and AMHS pose a significant
challenge. In CAMHS, treatment is reported to be more family-oriented
and holistic, inherent to the legal position of the parents, whereas in
adult psychiatry, individual patients and their symptoms are the main
focus. These differences are described by young people and their
families as an important reason for discontinuing care in
AMHS.\ :sup:`25` This perception may also lead to hesitance among CAMHS
clinicians to refer young people.\ :sup:`16` In addition, the lack of
common registration and information systems hampers the exchange of
information between services.\ :sup:`17`

.. _sec1-3:

Level of the individual
-----------------------

.. _sec1-3-1:

Youth and young adults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Characteristics specific to young people can influence the transition
process. Having a severe and enduring mental illness, e.g.
schizophrenia, enhances the chance of being referred to AMHS, whereas
having a neurodevelopmental disorder decreases the chance of being
referred. Moreover, receiving medication, having a history of hospital
admissions and living with both parents or independently are all
variables that can determine whether a young person is more likely to be
referred.\ :sup:`4,26–28`

Even if a transition to adult services has been carefully planned, a
young person's urge for autonomy and self-determination may influence
their care trajectory. For example, the young person can decide to
abandon psychological care or to not make the transition to AMHS, even
when a referral has been made.\ :sup:`4,26,28,29` The reasons for this
are diverse: young people want to solve their problems themselves, or
they may not want to repeat their story to a new clinician. The lack of
information about mental healthcare, the stigma associated with mental
health problems,\ :sup:`30,31` anxiety about how confidentiality is
handled and the physical accessibility of mental health services can all
act as barriers to seeking help or accessing care.\ :sup:`32` Young
people have also suggested that further investments should be made to
improve the accessibility of mental healthcare and have pointed out to
the importance of e-health.\ :sup:`17`

Furthermore, service (dis)engagement is influenced by an identity change
that accompanies the transition from CAMHS to AMHS. Besides adopting an
adult identity, transitioning to AMHS implies adopting a new illness
identity.\ :sup:`31` Although CAMHS is associated with temporary
psychopathology, AMHS is associated with having a severe and enduring
mental illness, as this is often the prerequisite for being referred to
or accepted by AMHS.\ :sup:`4` Disengagement can be attributed to
failure in adopting a new illness identity, an illness identity that is
incompatible with AMHS service remit or fractious professional
relationships between CAMHS and AMHS during the transition, which causes
anxiety and uncertainty to the young person.\ :sup:`31`

Although young people want to make autonomous decisions and are
concerned about the confidentiality of information, the loss of parental
or other psychosocial support is an important negative factor for care
continuation or adequate help-seeking behaviour.\ :sup:`32`

The relationship of trust with the CAMHS clinician must not be
forgotten, as at the transition to adult services this relationship
comes to an end. Entering into a new social and trust relationship at an
AMHS can be daunting for young people. On the other hand, a positive
relationship with the new clinician can enable the development of other
positive relationships.\ :sup:`33`

.. _sec1-3-2:

The parents and important others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parents' position changes the moment a young person becomes an
adult, as their legal right to be involved in the care for their child
is no longer there. Furthermore, because of the distinct service
cultures, CAMHS and AMHS clinicians' training regarding family
involvement differs considerably; in adult psychiatry, the focus is more
on the individual, not the family.\ :sup:`25,34`

The need to give a young person autonomy to make their own decisions
regarding treatment can be a difficult process for the parents, who may
also require additional support.\ :sup:`35` Many parents and carers
would like to remain involved in the treatment, although they respect
their child's wishes and their right to privacy.\ :sup:`36,37` They also
want psychoeducation about how to deal with their child and to attend
parent support groups where they can benefit from increased knowledge,
shared recognition and exchange of experiences.\ :sup:`38`

.. _sec1-3-3:

The clinician
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mental healthcare transition should be a planned and efficient process.
This implies starting on time to prepare individuals and their families
for the transition. Some authors state that this process should start at
14 years of age,\ :sup:`39` whereas others stress that it should start
at least 1 year before the transition boundary.\ :sup:`40` For the
process to be efficient, by the time the young person reaches the
transition boundary it should be clear whether they need further care or
not, and whether this care will be continued in CAMHS or whether a
referral to AMHS, or another type of service (e.g. private practice), is
appropriate. In any case, the clinician should consider all these
options to make the best possible decision.

To date, there is no consensus about this decision-making process, and
the follow-up trajectory of the young person thus depends on the
practitioner's clinical judgement. Because of the lack of transition
protocols, this clinical judgement is not usually based on a structured
assessment of transition-relevant factors, such as severity of symptoms,
the patient's motivation regarding further mental healthcare and the
risk and protective factors in several psychosocial domains.\ :sup:`13`
CAMHS and AMHS should, therefore, be supported in the initiation,
advancement and supervision of the transition process. The National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Cleverley *et al* have
produced guidelines on transition.\ :sup:`41,42` The Managing the Link
and Strengthening Transition from Child to Adult Mental Healthcare
(MILESTONE) project developed an instrument for assessing transition,
the Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure, a process called
managed transition, which uses the Transition Readiness and
Appropriateness Measure to guide clinicians' actions, and training
regarding transition.\ :sup:`43,44`

The transition process is also influenced by professional relationships
between CAMHS and AMHS. Clinicians' decisions regarding referrals may
depend on the (not always comprehensive) knowledge they have of the
other care provider and their prior experience with the service and
clinician.\ :sup:`45` Furthermore, incompatible beliefs about who is
responsible for the different steps during the transition process, lack
of confidence in AMHS staff in managing young people and different
cultural approaches in service delivery may also impede the transition
process.\ :sup:`18,46`

.. _sec2:

Improving transition through specific interventions
===================================================

Some of the above-mentioned challenges provide directions as to what
should be done in clinical practice and at policy level to improve the
transition process. On the other hand, effect studies are lacking and
there is a need for longitudinal research about different transition
trajectories and health outcomes.\ :sup:`16,47` Although care
trajectories, transition experiences and quality of transition have been
investigated within the UK,\ :sup:`1` Ireland,\ :sup:`28,46` the USA and
Australia,\ :sup:`16` no research has been performed about the care and
transition trajectories (both the experiences and the quality) in
relation to their effects on mental health in the long term. The
MILESTONE project contains a prospective study on the longitudinal
outcomes and experiences of young people reaching the transition
boundary within eight different European countries, taking into account
differences in the organisation of mental health systems, the age at
which transition takes place and the available services.\ :sup:`43,44`
The MILESTONE study will result in evidence- and practice-based
guidelines that clinicians can follow to support their decision-making
and direct their actions.

To prevent young people from falling through the care gap and to tailor
services to their specific needs, new service models have been
developed. Examples include mental health services in Australia, Canada
and some European countries that target the age group of 0–25 years.
Besides solely focusing on mental health, these services take into
account all aspects of psychosocial functioning.\ :sup:`48–50` Despite
the aim of trying to solve the problem of a shortage of tailored
services for this target group, some of these services are faced with an
additional transition boundary: the first around 12 years of age and the
second around 25 years of age, both of which need to be optimally
managed. At the current time, it is too early to conclude if these
models provide an answer to the longstanding problems of transition
barriers.

An alternative approach to bridge the transition gap is by improving the
liaison between CAMHS and AMHS, but keeping services as they currently
exist. To achieve this, diverse models to enhance joint-working between
services, including transition clinics and transition coordinators have
been suggested.\ :sup:`51–54`

.. _sec3:

Improving clinical practice
===========================

Policy makers should consider implementing the topic of transition in
the training program of clinicians as 94% of European psychiatric
trainees indicated further training regarding transition is
necessary.\ :sup:`23` Furthermore the distinct split between CAMHS and
AMHS should be revised as well as the separate funding, which may hamper
collaborative efforts.\ :sup:`13,42`

To ensure that the transition process is better managed, the transition
should be mentioned to the young person well in
advance,\ :sup:`17,41,42` whereby the young person should be involved in
the decision-making during all phases of the process.\ :sup:`22,42,55`
Guidelines and criteria regarding optimal transition can guide
clinicians during their clinical practice.\ :sup:`4,41,42` Furthermore,
standardised assessment of the young persons' needs when approaching the
transition boundary should become routine, although it is rarely done
nowadays.\ :sup:`13`

.. _sec4:

Conclusion
==========

The transition from CAMHS to AMHS is an important process for young
people with mental health problems. Literature shows that continuation
of care is a complex process, with important players at policy and
organisational levels, service level and at the level of individuals:
patients, their families and healthcare providers. At the moment,
specific programmes for young people are being developed. However,
research such as the MILESTONE project is needed to support these
interventions in an evidence-based manner.

We would like to thank Marc Hermans, past president of the European
Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS) board of psychiatry, for inviting us
to join the UEMS working group regarding transition. We are also very
grateful for the whole UEMS working group on transition for their
interest and plans to make transition part of the training of
psychiatrists throughout Europe. Furthermore, we would like to thank all
members of the MILESTONE consortium.
