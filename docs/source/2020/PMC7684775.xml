We conducted an interventional study including patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with oral antipsychotics, without previous experience of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs). They were randomised to either psychoeducation with motivational interviewing or a control group.

Participants in the intervention group were enrolled on giving written informed consent to participate in an intervention and to grant access to their own medical chart. If an individual refused to participate or was excluded for another reason, their matched comparator was excluded as well. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm (ref. 2015/47-31).</p><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="other"><title>Psychoeducation</title><p>As part of our earlier study, participants in the intervention group underwent a single semi-structured interview by a study nurse specialised in mental health (L.C.), in which perceptions and knowledge of antipsychotic formulations were examined.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In summary, the earlier study revealed that participants lacked knowledge regarding differences in plasma concentration, side-effects and risk of readmission to hospital between LAIs and oral treatment. At the end of the interview, the study nurse provided psychoeducation, discussing and correcting misconceptions of the differences between oral and LAI antipsychotics. The risk associated with gaps in medication was also discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="other"><title>Motivational interviewing</title><p>The semi-structured interview, which included questions on beliefs and attitudes to treatment, was followed by an adapted form of motivational interviewing based on the original principles of the technique.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> L.C. had received training from a professional trainer on motivational interviewing in a 3-day course prior to the study. Participants were encouraged to discuss their personal ideas and ambivalences regarding their illness and treatment.

Participants were not called for extra visits during the follow-up, and clinical events were noted as they appeared in the medical charts. Hospital admission was considered a proxy for relapse. We observed the frequency of participants in each group with a hospital admission before and after intervention respectively. During the follow-up period, we also measured the number of participants who switched from oral to LAI antipsychotics. We noted whether the switch had been instigated by the participant, by clear indication of this in the medical chart, as opposed to it being described as a decision made by the treating psychiatrist or not described at all. The former was considered a proxy for increased patient involvement.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4" sec-type="other"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Anonymised data were analysed using Prism 5.03 for Windows.

However, as at least five participants in the intervention group actively initiated the discussion of switching, the higher switching rate could also be explained by increased involvement in their treatment. This supports results from an earlier study by Barkhof et al, in which a targeted use of motivational interviewing seemed to improve medication adherence at least for certain groups of people with psychosis.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Their adapted form of motivational interviewing had an active provision of psychoeducation, which makes it to some extent comparable to our interview, although their intervention included several sessions and included people with a recent relapse.</p><p>The number of participants admitted to hospital at least once in the 18-month period before intervention was comparable between groups, with only one more participant in the intervention group being admitted. In the follow-up period after intervention the corresponding analysis showed, however, nine fewer admissions in the intervention group. This could indicate an effect of psychoeducation and motivational interviewing on admission frequency, which in turn could be a result of increased adherence and involvement in antipsychotic treatment. This is in line with previous studies, which have reported positive effects of the combination of psychoeducation and motivational interviewing on adherence.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Exploring patients' fears is a less frequently used technique, as reported in our earlier study, and participants in the same study lacked knowledge.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Moreover, other research groups have reported reluctance among medical professionals to initiate the discussion of treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The possible positive effect of psychoeducation and motivational interviewing may encourage a more exploring approach in treatment discussion with the patient.</p><sec id="sec3-1" sec-type="other"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. Individuals with cognitive disorders and acute relapse at the time of inclusion were excluded from the study, and generalisations to these patient groups cannot be made. Not all targeted individuals were included in the intervention group, either because they could not be reached or they opted out, and their respective comparators were then not included.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The participants were enrolled during regular visits, which are scheduled at least yearly, so the 18 months before intervention should be enough for most eligible participants. One could argue that patients who agreed to participate and had a least one visit in connection with the intervention represent a group with more commitment to their treatment and less prone to relapse at baseline than patients in general, creating selection bias. However, the number of admissions was comparable between the intervention group and the comparison group in the 18 months before intervention, suggesting similar illness characteristics. We lacked information on confounders such as socioeconomic status, illness duration and substance misuse. However, their potential impact on the results was limited by the randomisation process. All intervention visits were conducted by the same person, assuring consistency across visits. We used hospital admissions and switch to an LAI as proxies for relapse and for patient involvement respectively, which may be questioned. However, these outcomes were readily available hard outcomes in the medical charts,</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2" sec-type="other"><title>Clinical and research implications</title><p>A combination of psychoeducation and motivational interviewing may be a valuable tool in the care of people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, stimulating their involvement in treatment and reducing the frequency of readmissions, but further study is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Gabriella Br&#x000f6;ms</bold>, MD, PhD, is a post-doc in the Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. <bold>Lindah Cahling</bold>, is a specialist nurse with PRIMA Child and Adult Psychiatry, Stockholm, Sweden. <bold>Anders Berntsson</bold>, is a psychiatrist and head of clinic at PRIMA Child and Adult Psychiatry, Stockholm, Sweden. <bold>Lars &#x000d6;hrmalm</bold>, PhD, is a psychiatrist with PRIMA Child and Adult Psychiatry, and a researcher in the Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.</p></notes><sec id="sec-das" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data associated with the manuscript is available with the corresponding author.</p></sec><notes id="nts3" notes-type="other"><title>Author contributions</title><p>G.B., L.C., A.B. and L.&#x000d6;. contributed to the overall study design.
