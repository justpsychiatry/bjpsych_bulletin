This ABUHB programme is called Connecting with Telehealth to Children in Hospital and Healthcare (CWTCH). It is a National Health Service (NHS) quality improvement project that provides faster and more efficient appointments in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) using a communication platform called Attend Anywhere (<uri xlink:href="https://www.attendanywhere.com">https://www.attendanywhere.com</uri>). The programme tested the suitability and acceptability of telepsychiatry and measured satisfaction across a wide range of settings and uses, including paediatric wards for emergency assessments, out-patient appointments, medication reviews, autism assessments, school postvention clinics for pupil suicides, virtual groups and more. It demonstrated that telepsychiatry in CAMHS is a highly suitable adjunct to routine ways of working; once people became familiar with this way of holding appointments, it was rated as acceptable and satisfactory by patients, families and clinicians.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="other"><title>Rebranding of CWTCH and Royal College of Psychiatry endorsement</title><p>CWTCH has now been rebranded and is called CWTCH Cymru.

Clinician acceptance and use of video as an accepted alternative to established ways of working were found to be rate-limiting factors with respect to adoption and spread. This challenge is defined by the authors as &#x02018;clinician need versus clinical need&#x02019;. This definition suggests that video consultations are more likely to be adopted and accepted as a feasible approach to healthcare delivery when the &#x02018;need&#x02019; for this way of working is defined and accepted by the clinician or service, compared with when they are defined and accepted as a clinical need. In other words, video consultations are generally more successful and sustainable when a clinician or service perceives the need themselves and requests the service, rather when they are motivated by the projection of need or want from their patient population. It is therefore essential to establish and define this &#x02018;need&#x02019; within a service, seeing clinician/service &#x02018;pull&#x02019; for video consultation as an essential criterion for successful adoption. When the perceived need for video consultations by clinicians and services increased in the pandemic context, there was greater willingness to test new ways of working and overcome perceived or internal barriers to change. This has significant implications for how video consultations should be introduced into services and organisations, highlighting the need to focus on both the technical and the cultural aspects of the adoption process. These findings mirror the work of Greenhalgh et al and their &#x02018;NASSS&#x02019; (non-adoption, abandonment and barriers to spread, scale-up and sustainability) framework.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec2"><title>Rationale and objectives</title><p>Despite the increasingly widespread use of video consultations, there are very few visual and fully documented descriptions of how to set up and implement such consultations in real-time practice with specific attention to features such as fitting into existing systems and the legal and ethical requirements of video consultations.

In addition, your service will need to decide how the video consultation will be managed, how clinical templates and coding will be used for video consultations, and how these will be matched to existing systems.

Process mapping will help your team to define video consultations in the context of your service, understand who is responsible for what and where, and to flag up any potential concerns or risk exposures. Process mapping and risk assessment will help your service to start thinking about and understanding what types of risks may arise in specific situations, and possibly how to avoid them.</p><p>You would need to think about the following.

This would involve a &#x02018;what to do&#x02019; plan in the event of an emergency or concern arising during a virtual appointment. It is advised to list a wide range of scenarios, ranging from low- to high-risk possibilities. Make it as specific to your service as possible, to make potential scenarios relatable to your staff. When developing the contingency plan, think about who is best suited to develop it and who will be following it, and consider a wide range of opinions and possibilities. Develop a list of all possible scenarios and all levels of risk exposure, and make them specific, applicable and relatable to your service.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-3" sec-type="other"><title>Ethical guidelines</title><p>Video consultations, like any other form of healthcare delivery, will need to be treated exactly the same way as in-person care with regards to ethical guidelines and procedures. However, owing to the obvious remoteness of a virtual appointment, there are additional ethical considerations which need to be considered and applied, such as confidentiality, privacy and security issues.</p><p>It is essential that a video consultation service replicates an in-person appointment or assessment as much as possible. For example, the setting of an appointment room would ideally need to be the same as an in-person appointment room, e.g. if your service would normally use a private room for an in-person appointment, then a virtual appointment would also need this. It is also important to ensure that the platform used for video consultations is safe and secure, and that it meets your existing health systems standards, including software encryption. Many popular video chat platforms such as FaceTime and WhatsApp are not compliant with healthcare standards; therefore, you would need to seek out a safe and secure platform such as Attend Anywhere (<uri xlink:href="https://www.attendanywhere.com">https://www.attendanywhere.com</uri>).</p><p>Informed consent is the process of seeking agreement from a person before taking a course of action that requires consent. Informed consent is required from any person who is receiving a video consultation. There are two types of consent.
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Implied consent (or tacit consent), which is signalled by the behaviour of an informed person in agreement. This type of consent is typically used in the delivery of &#x02018;in-person&#x02019; healthcare.</p></list-item><list-item><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Explicit consent is when a person actively agrees, either verbally or in writing. This type of consent is highly recommended for video consultations, as signalled (implied) behaviour may be more difficult to capture remotely.</p></list-item></list></p><p>To obtain consent, the person giving it would need to be considered to fully understand the process and to have full capacity to do so. A person with incapacity, such as a child or vulnerable adult, may not be able to give informed consent; therefore, parental or guardian consent (known as assent) would be required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="other" id="sec7"><title>A guide to conducting the video consultation</title><p>The final step of this guide describes how to use video consultations in a secondary healthcare service (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).

This resource has been used to support clinicians to gain the technical skills and knowledge required to routinely use video consultations in practice. In addition, we found that there is an important &#x02018;cultural&#x02019; aspect to successful adoption of video consultations, where the rate-limiting factor for successful adoption is the &#x02018;need&#x02019; and &#x02018;pull&#x02019; for this way of working to be defined and accepted by the clinician or ser vice.</p><p>When the perceived need for video consultations by clinicians and services increased in the pandemic context, there was greater willingness to test new ways of working and overcome perceived or internal barriers to change. It will be interesting to see whether having made the change to this new way working in the pandemic context, clinicians and services actively choose to maintain these newly gained technical skills &#x02013; and also whether patients and carers, having experienced video consultations for the first time, increase their demand for this to become a new &#x02018;routine&#x02019; way of working. As use of video consultations increases, we will also undoubtedly learn how to titrate this offer according to need, circumstance and demographics, and discover which healthcare treatments can best be deployed or augmented through the use of video consultations.</p><p>This paper provides a guide to using video consultations in the NHS, based on personal experience of the authors and feedback from their evaluation. However, it is still early days for video consultations in Wales, and more research is needed to understand more about their use, particularly what can and can't be done using video consultation, as this is still unspeculative and unproven.</p></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Gemma Johns</bold> is Research &#x00026; Evaluation Lead of CWTCH and TEC Cymru ABUHB, Wales, UK.
