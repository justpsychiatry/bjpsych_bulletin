This study in the Scottish Highlands aimed to characterise the nature of police involvement with those detained under place of safety legislation, the demographics of this population and aspects of the assessment process to determine factors that might be associated with admission.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Method</title><p>We conducted a retrospective study by review of medical case records, including Place of Safety forms (POS1, v7.0) completed by police constables, of all individuals brought under place of safety legislation to New Craigs Hospital, Inverness in the NHS Highland region (the designated place of safety for the NHS Highland health board) between April 2016 and March 2017. All place of safety referrals were included in the project, including repeat detentions for any one individual. Individuals who were already in-patients when the place of safety legislation was applied were excluded from the analyses regarding admission to hospital.</p><p>Referrals were identified by collecting POS1 forms from the medical records department and cross-referencing with a place of safety referral record sheet in the intensive psychiatric care unit (IPCU), which is where most place of safety referrals are assessed. The junior doctor's assessment book and mental health assessment team's diary were also consulted to ensure that as many place of safety referrals as possible were identified. In an attempt to determine completeness of these records the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland was contacted. Information about the assessment team's wider activity was gained from their team diary, which is updated reliably after each assessment. The POS1 form completed by police is not statutory and therefore any referral identified in case notes as being under place of safety legislation was included.</p><p>The POS1 form has an open text box to give details of the &#x02018;circumstances giving rise to the removal of the aforementioned person to a place of safety.&#x02019; In all cases where a POS1 form was available this information was qualitatively analysed to characterise the nature of police involvement, the reasons for concerns and the reasons for the decisions made. Diagnosis was determined from clinical records and kept to broad ICD-10 diagnostic categories; more than one diagnosis was permitted, for example comorbid substance misuse and personality disorder. Diagnoses were often already established from clinical records rather than being based on the single urgent assessment.</p><p>Population data for calculating rates of referral are from census data from National Records of Scotland, a non-ministerial government department charged with collecting information about Scotland's people and history.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>The project was part of service development and audit and therefore did not require ethical approval.</p><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="other"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Minitab 17.1.0 and SPSS 22.0 statistical software, both for Windows. The association between categorical and outcome variables was assessed using Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-tests; where the cell count was low the likelihood-ratio chi-squared test was used. For continuous variables, Student's <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed. Given repeated referrals of some individuals, multivariable binary logistic mixed-effects regression was performed to predict admission using individuals as the random effect in order to account for individual-specific effect and control for the fixed effects of age, gender, diagnosis and distance from place of safety on detention. Robust estimation procedure was used to obtain the estimate of covariance matrix in order to ensure that model assumptions were met. Estimates of effects are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

The recording of these referrals in the hospital appears to be reliable and numbers are in keeping with data from the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> NHS Highland accounts for perhaps up to 20% of all place of safety referrals in Scotland;<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> this is proportionately lower than a local study 10 years ago, when up to 50% were in the NHS Highland health board.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, it is of note that in the current study almost 70% of place of safety referrals occurred within a few miles of the designated place of safety. This is unlikely to be simply due to population factors despite the place of safety being located in Inverness. The place of safety referral rate per year for Inverness is 248 per 100&#x000a0;000 &#x02013; over 10 times the rate for Scotland as a whole and 3 times that for the health board with the highest referral rate in Scotland.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Under-reporting in some Scottish health boards is likely to contribute to this variation but does not fully explain the vast differences. Looking more broadly, this referral rate is also significantly higher than in studies in England, where rates are reported between 59.8 per 100&#x000a0;000 in the North-East<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and 169 per 100&#x000a0;000 in Ipswich, Suffolk.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> There appears to be excessive use of this restrictive legislation in Inverness &#x02013; factors driving this are likely to be poorer joint working, workload pressures and a lack of availability of alternative options of disposal/help for those in crisis. There are a striking number of referrals where individuals have sought help from police rather than from local mental health services. This supports the proposal in a recent Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland place of safety report that there is a gap between service provision and the needs of this distressed population.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Police are responding to distressed individuals in a range of locations, from their own home to high-risk situations on major roads or high bridges. Where place of safety legislation is used, this is overwhelmingly in response to concerns about suicide risk. This study does show that police do well in identifying those in need of mental health support &#x02013; the admission rate of police referrals is identical to that from other sources and they detail evidence of psychosis on their referrals. The language used by police in describing behaviours includes terms such as &#x02018;highly emotional&#x02019; and &#x02018;hysterical&#x02019; &#x02013; these are commonly used terms but could be stigmatising for those with mental health difficulties. Targeted training and support for officers may well improve their interaction with distressed individuals and make involvement with police a less daunting experience for those with mental health problems.</p><p>The characteristics of those referred under place of safety legislation in the Scottish Highlands are similar to those reported elsewhere in terms of age, gender and outcome.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, in this study substance misuse problems are possibly more prevalent and were felt to be contributing to presentation in almost 50% of referrals whereas the proportion of severe mental illness is probably slightly lower.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The compulsory admission rate is significantly lower (15%, compared with up to 50%) than in other reports, likely reflective of the lower proportion of individuals with severe mental illness.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>This study identified that presence of senior nurses influenced outcomes of assessments and recognised that there is significant variability in admission rates by doctors at all training grades. It is therefore important to ensure that experienced staff are conducting assessments and consideration should be given to a model that ensures multidisciplinary input such as that used in England and Wales,<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> where approved mental health professionals (AMHPs) support the assessment process, including follow-up care arrangements for those not admitted. Further, with evidence in Scotland that trainees are doing fewer emergency assessments,<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> ensuring that trainees are well supported by senior medical staff in completing these assessments is crucial.</p><sec id="sec3-1" sec-type="other"><title>Predicting outcomes and length of hospital stay</title><p>Predicting outcome of assessments is challenging given the nature of any mental health crisis, as difficulties are very individualised. However, diagnosis appears to be a primary factor in the decision-making process. In general, where referrals are identified as being related to primarily social stressors or substance misuse problems admission to hospital is avoided or, where felt necessary, kept as short as possible. A diagnosis of severe mental illness was associated with admission but not any particular length of admission, and perhaps in some cases a short admission plays a containing role rather than being for treatment itself when individuals are presenting via police. Personality disorder diagnosis was associated with admission to hospital despite extensive local training, resource and a new integrated care pathway which states that admission for those with personality disorder is &#x02018;at best neutral and at worst harmful&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> It is likely that a combination of factors influence the decision to admit &#x02013; those with personality disorder diagnoses may be in a high degree of crisis that cannot always be de-escalated over a single assessment and may be thought of as being at high acute risk of suicide, given their language, circumstances, social supports or expression of plans for suicide following assessment if they leave the place of safety. In addition, they may be displaying &#x02018;pseudopsychotic&#x02019; phenomena that are felt to require admission for further assessment. In this context the seniority and experience of the assessing team is also likely to be important.</p><p>If individuals were detained further from the place of safety, admission was more likely &#x02013; this is probably related to service provision in more rural areas, i.e. lack of crisis response teams as well as practicalities in supporting discharge to more rural areas in the evenings and overnight.</p><p>Expression of suicidality or self-harm in itself is not helpful in determining outcome, although it is an important factor in decision-making and risk assessment/management. Given that suicidal expression is actually associated with not being admitted, it may be that in such circumstances services could offer alternative interventions or supports (to police and individuals) to avoid use of legislation and the &#x02018;frightening&#x02019; experience of being detained under place of safety legislation.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Future studies exploring outcomes and service use in those with suicidality not admitted would be helpful in guiding service development and delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2" sec-type="other"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has a lengthy period of data collection and a relatively large sample. This makes it similar to other studies in this field, which helps to allow any variation/patterns to be identified. Characteristics of the population are also similar to those reported elsewhere. This is the first study to analyse the nature of police involvement and link this with outcome of the mental health assessment. Efforts were made to ensure that all recognised place of safety referrals, especially those with completed POS1 forms, were identified over the study period &#x02013; unfortunately, despite being contacted the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland did not provide information to cross-reference those included in the project, which would strengthen the data-set. However, given the multiple sources and communications systems within the hospital and across the health board we are confident that the majority of place of safety referrals were identified. The study was carried out retrospectively, which limits the information available. Given the retrospective nature and use of a clinical cohort, diagnostic categories were kept broad and thus open to a degree of interpretation. However, the decisions and diagnoses made reflect day-to-day practice and thus findings are clinically informative.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3" sec-type="other"><title>Improving practice</title><p>When individuals are brought by police to a place of safety it is important to complete an individualised assessment. Diagnosis is an important factor in the decision-making process and practitioners should remember that individuals not expressing suicidal ideation also have a significant mental health burden and may require admission. Experienced practitioners should be involved in multidisciplinary assessment where possible and it is crucial that junior medical staff are well supported by senior colleagues in making decisions.</p><p>Police are frequently responding to mental health crises and seem to do well in identifying those in need of urgent service contact.
