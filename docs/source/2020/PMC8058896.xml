Its usefulness has been demonstrated in medical settings, where it generates enhanced staff understanding and improved, coordinated delivery of care.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Research indicates similar benefits in behavioural crisis units<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but its use in an emergency department liaison psychiatry setting has not been demonstrated. Although psychiatric patients comprise a minority of emergency department presentations, they require a disproportionate amount of time and resources, which can frustrate emergency department staff and cause negative attitudes towards such patients.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Myriad factors underlie this, such as lengthy waiting times, interpersonal difficulties and procedural ambiguity. These factors are often longstanding and resistant to change, but lean management processes, when executed appropriately, are an accessible and effective way of effecting meaningful change.</p><p>Prolonged length of stay was a recurrent source of contention and discontent in this emergency department before the process was undertaken. Boarding or lodging of psychiatric patients awaiting admission to psychiatric units is common and, for various reasons, these patients spend longer in the department than their medical and surgical counterparts.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The requirement for &#x02018;medical screening&#x02019; is contributory, but avoidable non-clinical factors, such as health insurance or lack of transport, are known to play a significant role.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In addition to straining resources, patients who spend longer in an emergency department are more likely to suffer adverse outcomes or incidents, such as medication errors.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Workplace incivility is a further stressor that is reportedly commonplace in emergency departments,<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and is compounded by the phenomenon of &#x02018;silo working&#x02019;, whereby different departments operate in isolation from each other.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In addition to contributing to an unpleasant work environment, interpersonal conflicts interfere with provision of collaborative and efficient care. Efficient and coordinated delivery of care is essential to optimising the quality of treatment provided.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><sec disp-level="2" id="sec1-1" sec-type="other"><title>Aims</title><p>

Some studies have measured patient satisfaction before and after implementation of this method, but found no statistically significant difference.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> To our knowledge, the benefits of this method have not been studied in liaison psychiatry. The differences that exist between liaison psychiatry and other services, in particular the inherent unpredictability of an emergency department liaison psychiatry service, make it a unique setting that warrants particular attention. Lean methods have been applied to acute emergency settings<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and behavioural health crisis settings,<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> both more similar to our service, but those studies did not assess the function of an emergency psychiatry service within a general emergency department, as is commonly the setting for the provision of emergency psychiatric care in Ireland and the UK. One such study of a stand-alone crisis centre found a significant improvement in door-to-door dwell time, but, as a disparate service to ours, without comparable interdisciplinary challenges, the findings are difficult to relate to a hospital setting.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>The use of process mapping in the present study afforded us the opportunity to visualise the journey of the psychiatric patient as they interacted with each individual stakeholder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) and as they were processed through the interdisciplinary department (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Doing so, we were able to set realistic, practical, timely and finite goals, thereby measurably improving efficiency. Further to this, we hoped that this process might help to improve the quality of working relationships between individuals and departments.</p><p>Lengthy waiting times of mentally ill patients in an emergency department exert stress on resources and increase the risk of adverse incidents.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Before undertaking this quality improvement project, their median length of stay in this department (8&#x000a0;h) significantly exceeded the national target of 6&#x000a0;h. The National Emergency Medicine Programme in the jurisdiction of Ireland aims to ensure that 95% of patients are processed within 6&#x000a0;h.<sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Process mapping and the series of interventions that followed led to a significant reduction in length of stay (median 7&#x000a0;h), with a particular reduction in the number of lengthy waiting times (5% exceeding 24&#x000a0;h pre-mapping, 2% exceeding 24&#x000a0;h post-mapping). This outcome, we postulate, was achieved by improving staff relations and agreeing on a series of low-burden and low-cost practical changes.</p><p>One such practical change was the management and prevention of acute agitation in mentally ill patients in the emergency department. The application of process maps enabled the stakeholder group to deconstruct the chain of events leading up to acute agitation:
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>delayed handover following psychiatric assessment caused ambiguity about management (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, proposal (a))</p></list-item><list-item><p>psychiatric registrars reported being unable to identify the appropriate person in the emergency department to receive handovers (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, proposals (a) and (b))</p></list-item><list-item><p>the head of emergency department nursing observed that delays in administration of oral medication in the early stages of behavioural disturbance precipitated escalation of the behavioural disturbance, requiring emergency administration of intramuscular medication (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; proposal (e))</p></list-item><list-item><p>healthcare assistants observed that long periods spent in the contained environment of the emergency department led to patients becoming more irritable, but the assistants did not feel equipped to supervise time out of the department</p></list-item><list-item><p>security staff were willing to supervise breaks with the healthcare assistant, but were unclear about their legal obligations and safeguards in relation to restraining and detaining patients (<xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; proposal (f)).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Consensus on such solutions could not have been reached in the absence of this process, as non-clinical security staff and healthcare assistants &#x02013; who provided important information and insights that were key to implementing solutions &#x02013; are not routinely consulted by senior clinical and management staff. These types of solution, especially in cases such as this, reduce risks to patients and staff and reduce the burden on resources, thereby allowing the department to run more efficiently.</p><p>Further to these measurable benefits, process mapping facilitated progression from silo working to a cohesive team approach. The phenomenon of silo working leaves individual staff members feeling isolated and unsure about what to do or where to find help,<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> especially in highly stressful situations such as a patient's acute agitation. Clarification of departmental policies and pathways, paired with improved individual flexibility and collegiality, empowered individuals to navigate difficult situations as a team so that interdisciplinary solutions were generated with minimal conflict. Process mapping provided a structure for this conversation to take place, thereby enhancing collegiality and collaborative care.</p><sec id="sec4-1" sec-type="other"><title>Limitations</title><p>For process mapping to be successful in creating a consensus of opinion, the interviewer must remain objective. This process-mapping exercise was led by a senior registrar on the psychiatry team. Ideally, the lead role would be undertaken by an external participant, to avoid introducing interviewer bias (or the perception of interviewer bias by the stakeholders). This was not possible within the limits of our resources. This did not emerge as an obstacle in this study, probably because of the considerable trust between the specialties, but an independent interviewer would be essential if relationships were more fractious.</p><p>Compounding this, participants in this project were vulnerable to recall and reporting bias due to the retrospective nature of the interviews and the fact that they were asked to consider the pathway common to the majority of psychiatric cases, rather than specific cases.</p><p>Having evaluated the success of this process, it appears that neither of these limitations was prohibitive.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="other"><title>Recommendations for utilising process maps in healthcare</title><sec id="sec4-2-1" sec-type="other"><title>Adhering to structure</title><p>We found that both the interviewer and stakeholders were tempted to offer personal conclusions and suggestions in stage I, which could have led to individual maps being contaminated by an individual's personal agenda. It was important throughout this process to remind the stakeholders that any useful solutions must be raised through the focus-group meeting in stages II and III.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2-2" sec-type="other"><title>Completing the full process</title><p>Change management requires energy and motivation and we found that sustaining momentum was a struggle at times. Process mapping does not serve its function if it ends after stage I, so persistence through stages II and III is needed to enable meaningful change to be made. It can be a challenge to convince busy professionals to sacrifice valuable time, but the value of participation en masse cannot be matched by only one or two people. Active involvement of consultants and heads of department from the outset is vital.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-2-3" sec-type="other"><title>A word of caution</title><p>Not all situations are amenable to process mapping, so this method should be carefully considered before applying it to a problem situation.</p><p>Process mapping is a tool developed to examine a process, not a population. It is not designed to mediate interpersonal conflicts. Although we observed an improved sense of trust and collegiality, process mapping cannot enhance trust in a relationship where none exists.</p><p>The problems described herein are particular to our liaison psychiatry service, and may not mirror the challenges faced by other specialties or services; however, the general challenges encountered in the day-to-day provision of healthcare (e.g. inefficient use of resources and a tendency to resort to silo working) are ubiquitous across all settings. We have identified a method of overcoming these pitfalls. This experience can provide a blueprint for undertaking this kind of work in other fields of healthcare. We have found it a useful tool for enhancing working relationships and implementing immediate, lasting and meaningful change.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><notes id="nts1" notes-type="other"><title>About the authors</title><p><bold>Lauren Alexander</bold>, MB BCh, BAO, MRCPsych, is a senior registrar in St Vincent's Psychiatric Hospital, Dublin; a postgraduate clinical research registrar in the Department of Psychiatry, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin; and an MD candidate at University College, Dublin. <bold>Susan Moore</bold>, MB BCh, BAO, MRCPsych, is a consultant in liaison psychiatry in the Department of Liaison Psychiatry, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin. <bold>Nigel Salter</bold>, MB BCh, BAO, FRCP, FRCEM, is a consultant in emergency medicine in the Emergency Department, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin. <bold>Leonard Douglas</bold>, MB BCh, BAO, MRCPsych, is a consultant in old age psychiatry in the Department of Old Age Psychiatry, St Vincent's University Hospital and is based at Carew House, Dublin, Ireland.</p></notes><ref-list id="reflist1"><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cite1"><name><surname>Casey</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brinton</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name>
