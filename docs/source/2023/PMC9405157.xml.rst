:Abstract:
   Individuals with schizophrenia have higher mortality and shorter
   lifespans. There are a multitude of factors which create these
   conditions, but one aspect is worse physical health, particularly
   cardiovascular and metabolic health. Many interventions to improve
   the health of individuals with schizophrenia have been created, but
   on the whole, there has been limited effectiveness in improving
   quality of life or lifespan. One potential new avenue for inquiry
   involves a more patient-centric perspective; understanding aspects of
   physical health most important, and potentially most amenable to
   change, for individuals based on their life narratives. This study
   used topic modeling, a type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on
   unstructured speech samples from individuals (*n* = 366) with serious
   mental illness, primarily schizophrenia, in order to extract topics.
   Speech samples were drawn from three studies collected over a decade
   in two geographically distinct regions of the United States. Several
   health-related topics emerged, primarily centered around food, living
   situation, and lifestyle (e.g., routine, hobbies). The implications
   of these findings for how individuals with serious mental illness and
   schizophrenia think about their health, and what may be most
   effective for future health promotion policies and interventions, are
   discussed.

1. Introduction
===============

It is well established that individuals with schizophrenia and other
serious mental illnesses (SMI), such as bipolar disorder,
schizoaffective disorder, and major depressive disorder, have higher
mortality and reduced life expectancy [(De Hert et al. 2011)].
Specifically, individuals with schizophrenia live approximately fifteen
years less than populations without serious mental illness [(Hjorthøj et
al. 2017)].). This higher mortality is in part due to higher natural
causes of death, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other
illnesses [(De Hert et al. 2011),(Brown, Inskip, and Barraclough
2000),(Saha et al. 2005)],with cardiovascular diseases representing the
leading cause of death for these individuals [(Westman et al. 2018)].
Substantial inquiry has explored the contributory causes in this
population which lead to higher negative health outcomes, such as
cardiovascular events and other metabolic diseases such as diabetes
[(Goff et al. 2005),(Von Hausswolff-Juhlin et al. 2009)]. Many major
factors which connect mental health conditions to poor physical health
outcomes have been identified, such as side effects of psychiatric
medications, lack of access to or engagement in physical activity, lack
of access to healthy food and other diet related factors, and substance
use, particularly higher rates of nicotine and alcohol use [(Connolly
and Kelly 2005),(McCreadie and Group 2003),(Scott et al. 2013)].
Notably, not all studies have found consistent disparities in health
behaviors in the serious mental illness population, particularly
regarding mixed findings around exercise and cigarette use [(Dickerson
et al. 2006),(Holmberg and Kane 1999),(Parletta, Aljeesh, and Baune
2016)] though see also [(Janney et al. 2015)] for significant disparity
in sedentarity. However, the consistent finding of poorer health
outcomes has stimulated significant efforts to close the health and
life-expectancy gap for individuals with schizophrenia, and SMI more
broadly, and improving physical health for these populations is a
critical issue.

Unfortunately, after decades of research on health promotion and
self-management interventions, there are no indicators that the physical
health of individuals with schizophrenia has improved, and, in fact, the
mortality gap appears to be widening [(Saha et al. 2005),(Hayes et al.
2017)] (though see [(Tanskanen, Tiihonen, and Taipale 2018)] for
evidence that in some countries, it has not widened). Many interventions
have been focused on improving individuals’ health behaviors with
varying effectiveness (e.g., [(Cabassa et al. 2017),(Lorig et al.
2014),(Scheewe et al. 2013)]). While increasing individual health
behaviors is undoubtedly an important component of improving the overall
health of individuals with schizophrenia, there are several systemic
components which must also be addressed, including stigma [(Goldman,
Spaeth-Rublee, and Pincus 2018),(Lancet 2016)], diagnostic
overshadowing, where individuals’ physical concerns are ignored in favor
of their psychiatric symptoms [(Crawford et al. 2014),(L. Roberts et al.
2007),(Shefer et al. 2014)], and access to health-promoting environments
[(Kidd et al. 2016),(Rastad, Martin, and Åsenlöf 2014),(Rotenberg et al.
2022)]. Focusing solely on the individual, without understanding the
broader context, will likely be insufficient for understanding what is
necessary in improving the physical health and reducing the mortality of
individuals with schizophrenia. Indeed, new applications of ecological
frameworks to schizophrenia symptomatology have underscored the
importance of understanding environmental contributions for symptoms
[(Strauss 2021)], and similar thinking may be relevant and required for
physical health promotion as well.

Qualitative findings from focus group discussions of individuals with
SMI have also emphasized the importance of understanding context.
Individuals with SMI who participated in focus groups identified that
their social surroundings could be a significant help (e.g., emotional,
practical, mutual support from family members or significant others) or
barrier to health behavior change [(Aschbrenner et al. 2013)]. While
these effects are not limited to individuals with SMI, they may be
compounded by other structural impacts on the social environments of
individuals with SMI, e.g., less access to public spaces due to stigma
or transportation/safety concerns and more limited social networks
[(Degnan et al. 2018)].

Shrinking the mortality gap between individuals with and without SMI
will require intervention on multiple levels, including individual,
contextual, and systemic barriers to health, and is an urgent problem.
This combination of urgency and complexity highlights the need for
effective and efficient interventions. But, to know what will be
effective and efficient in the lives of individuals with SMI, their
expertise must be included. There has been significant work, often in
the context of designing and evaluating behavioral health interventions,
on what individuals with schizophrenia see as the barriers and
facilitators of their health change (e.g., [(Rastad, Martin, and Åsenlöf
2014),(S. H. Roberts and Bailey 2013),(Shiner et al. 2008),(Wright et
al. 2006),(Yarborough et al. 2016)]). Individuals with SMI identify
substantial concerns around their physical health [(Wright et al.
2006),(Yarborough et al. 2016)]. Several of these studies highlighted
how strong patient-care provider relationships, and general social
relationships, can support the individual’s health-promoting behaviors
and facilitate navigating barriers [(Rastad, Martin, and Åsenlöf
2014),(Shiner et al. 2008),(Wright et al. 2006),(Yarborough et al.
2016)]. On the other hand, social norms around health behaviors,
particularly around food, can be a hinderance to making lifestyle
changes, as can symptoms such as amotivation or depression [(Rastad,
Martin, and Åsenlöf 2014),(Yarborough et al. 2016)]. They cohere with
the quantitative findings on the importance of health behaviors and
health promotion for individuals with schizophrenia, and the critical
roles of social systems both formal and informal. They also highlight
how specific barriers, such as psychiatric symptoms and medication, may
be particularly at play for this population [(Yarborough et al. 2016)].
However, these qualitative inquiries are often particularly targeted to
a specific intervention, particularly interventions around exercise and
diet (though see [(Wright et al. 2006)] for a systems-oriented
perspective).

This study aims to continue the trajectory of centering individuals’
lived experience and perception of their health and wellbeing, but in a
larger and more varied context than is feasible or applicable for
qualitative inquiries. Using topic analysis, a Natural Language
Processing (NLP) method which allows for the automatic extraction of
relevant topics, we aim to explore how individuals with schizophrenia
perceive their own physical health behaviors as part of their larger
life context. In topic analysis, the words in a transcribed speech
sample are clustered according to an algorithm, which has been trained
on a large corpus. These topics, consisting of contextually similar
clusters of words, can then be qualitatively assigned a name, much in
the way one would if doing an exploratory factor analysis. We aimed to
identify if individuals with schizophrenia discussed behaviors relevant
to physical health in unstructured and untargeted speech samples, and,
if so, what kinds of health-relevant topics emerged. In an exploratory
manner, we also aimed to identify how individuals themselves valence
their own physical health promoting or detrimental behaviors, and what
the broader context of those behaviors are. Lastly, we compared whether
the frequency of topics differed in the group of individuals with
schizophrenia, relative to other serious mental illness diagnoses or
controls without a mental illness diagnosis. By exploring these
perspectives, we will gain new insights on the aspects of health which
are most relevant and most valued for individuals with schizophrenia,
informing potential intervention and policy development to improve
physical health and reduce mortality for this marginalized community.

2. Methods
==========

.. _sec2dot1-behavsci-12-00286:

2.1. Participants
-----------------

This study drew from archival data from three studies. Further details
regarding these studies are reported elsewhere [(Cohen et al.
2008),(Cohen et al. 2014),(Docherty et al. 2003)], and only details
relevant to the current inquiry will be reported here. For participant
demographic information, including age, gender distributions, diagnostic
status, and racial/ethnic distributions, please see `Table
1 <#behavsci-12-00286-t001>`__. Average age of participants was 39.8
years old (*SD* = 10.1, range = 18–67).

.. _sec2dot2-behavsci-12-00286:

2.2. Measures
-------------

.. _sec2dot2dot1-behavsci-12-00286:

2.2.1. Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In each study, participants were audio recorded while they discussed
memories from their lives. See `Table 1 <#behavsci-12-00286-t001>`__ for
details regarding each study’s procedure. For two of the studies, these
were conducted as part of a semi-structured conversation with the
research assistant. For one of the studies, this was conducted as part
of a monologue for which prompts and probes were provided to the
participant before and during the speaking task. For two of the studies,
positive, negative, and neutral affectively valenced memories were
separately elicited as part of the speaking task instructions and the
follow-up probes. For the other study, affective valence was ambiguous
with respect to initial instructions, and participants were allowed to
explore whatever affectively valenced memories they deemed important.
Recordings were hand-transcribed by trained research assistants, and
interviewer speech was removed from the samples for this study. After
filtering, we had 1482 transcripts from 366 individuals (*M* (*SD*) =
4.04 (2.3), range = 1–8).

.. _sec2dot2dot2-behavsci-12-00286:

2.2.2. Natural Language Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Python (v3.8) and Natural Language Toolkit Library (NLTK) [(Loper
and Bird 2002)], documents were filtered by length (character length >
50; word length > 10), contractions were expanded, stop-words (e.g.,
the, an, a, should) were removed, and filtered for alphanumeric
characters and phrases (periods, commas, hyphens, and apostrophes were
retained). After cleaning and filtering, we had 1481 text documents
transcribed from videos (*M* (*SD*) *=* 601 (585), range = 50–2763 words
per document).

.. _sec2dot3-behavsci-12-00286:

2.3. Topic Analysis
-------------------

To extract topics, BERTopic [(Grootendorst 2022)] was used to identify
frequent similar phrases, clustered into topics. We chose BERTopic over
the many other clustering algorithms because of its ease of use,
interactive visualizations for inspecting topics, and automatic
optimization of the number of topics (k). Unlike traditional Latent
Dirichlet Allocation methods [(Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003)], BERTopic
does not require you to set as an input the number of clusters. After
dimensionality reduction, it finds dense areas of similar documents in
the vector space using HDBScan [(McInnes, Healy, and Astels 2017)], a
density-based clustering algorithm. We used BERTopic library, ngrams
between 1 and 3 words, and the ‘all-mpnet-base-v2′, a pre-trained
sentence transformer based on Microsoft’s ‘mpnet-base’ that maps
sentences and paragraphs to a dense vector space and can be used for
tasks like clustering or semantic search. This model was used because it
was developed as a sentence and short paragraph encoder, in contrast to
models that were trained on longer, multi-paragraph documents. BERTopic
then uses a class-based term frequency inverse document frequency
(c-TF-IDF) algorithm to identify human-interpretable topics whilst
keeping important words in the topic description [(Grootendorst 2022)].
C-TF-IDF compares the importance of terms within a cluster and creates
easily interpretable term representation: the higher the value is for a
term, the more representative it is of its topic. Ultimately, in order
to better analyze the potentially large array of topics, BERTopic offers
an interactive intertopic distance map and hierarchical clustering for
inspecting individual topics [(Grootendorst 2022)]. Once an initial
overview of the topics becomes available, an automated topic reduction
can be performed again.

.. _sec2dot4-behavsci-12-00286:

2.4. Data Analysis
------------------

We used Chi-squared tests to compare the frequency of topics between the
following groups: (a) Individuals with an SMI diagnosis broadly and
controls, (b) individuals with schizophrenia, individuals with another
SMI diagnosis, and controls, and (c) Black and White participants. These
group comparisons were performed using a one-way Chi-squared test on the
distribution across all topics.

Topics were identified as “health-related” by evaluating cosine
similarity scores between each topic and health-related terms. Cosine
similarity is a method for approximating how similar two units of text
(words, phrases, sentences, or documents) are using text embeddings. In
brief, text embeddings are a vector (numerical) representation of a
document, word, or sentence in semantic space, calculated by the
probability of text appearing close to each other in natural language.
Natural language is often composed of text found on Wikipedia, social
media, or other large corpora such as news articles, books, or social
media. Cosine similarity scores are calculated by subtracting the cosine
distance between two vectors in semantic space from one. The further the
words are in semantic space (not similar), the closer their cosine
similarity score is to 0. Once topics were identified, we searched
resulting topics and terms that had high cosine similarity (>0.5) to
health-related terms (i.e., “health”, “exercise”, “smoking”, “alcohol”,
“sleep”, and “self-care”). We assigned emotional valence to
health-related topics by qualitatively inspecting the top 10 individual
words in health-related topics (`Table 2 <#behavsci-12-00286-t002>`__).
We compared the frequency of health-related topics among groups using a
two-way Chi-square test for 7 health-related topics and all other
topics.

3. Results
==========

.. _sec3dot1-behavsci-12-00286:

3.1. What General Topics Emerged?
---------------------------------

Topic analysis revealed 42 distinct topics (`Table
2 <#behavsci-12-00286-t002>`__; `Supplementary Table
S1 <#app1-behavsci-12-00286>`__). Names were given based on the terms
that contributed the most to a topic in reference to their C-TF-IDF
weights. `Figure 1 <#behavsci-12-00286-f001>`__ illustrates the
distribution of all topics and how similarly they cluster with one
another. Globally, the distribution of topics was significantly
different between individuals with an SMI diagnosis and controls
(Chi-squared = 54.124, *p* = 0.004). These differences did not appear to
be driven by ethnicity, as the distribution of global topics was not
significantly different between racial/ethnic groups (Chi-squared =
30.173, *p* = 0.456).

Several topics were discussed at greater frequency (4, 7, 11, 12) in
individuals with an SMI diagnosis compared to the control group (see
`Figure 2 <#behavsci-12-00286-f002>`__). When considering only
individuals with an SMI diagnosis, Topics 4, 5, 15, 28 were discussed at
a significantly different frequency in schizophrenia patients than in
patients with other SMI diagnoses. These included pertinent terms like
food, hobbies, relaxing, work, fun memories, people, job, and
medication. Lastly, there were 16 non-health-related topics discussed
amongst individuals with an SMI diagnosis that were not discussed in the
control group. These topics included terms such as family relationships,
work, stress, mental illness, and mental health. While these topics and
constituent terms have a qualitative overlap with “health”, they were
not included in our top seven health-related terms based on a cosine
similarity threshold of 0.5.

.. _sec3dot2-behavsci-12-00286:

3.2. What Health Related Topics Emerge and How Are They Emotionally Valenced?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seven topics were revealed to have health-related themes. These topics
and their emotional valences are also listed in `Table
2 <#behavsci-12-00286-t002>`__, along with a select few other topics for
comparison.

.. _sec3dot3-behavsci-12-00286:

3.3. Is Frequency of Health-Related Topics Related to Patient Group?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Health-related topics were discussed in greater frequency by individuals
with SMI when compared to controls (Chi-squared = 5.994, *p* = 0.014),
but these topics were not discussed differently by individuals with
schizophrenia versus other SMI diagnoses (Chi-Squared = 3.841, *p*
=0.475). Importantly, three health-related topics were discussed in
individuals with schizophrenia, but not individuals with other SMI
diagnoses. When comparing individuals with schizophrenia and those with
other SMI diagnoses, we found that Topics 1 “hobbies”, 3 “routine”, 10
“scared”, and 13 “religion” were individually discussed at different
frequencies.

.. _sec4-behavsci-12-00286:

4. Discussion
=============

The primary finding from this inquiry is that, even without a specific
health-related prompt, individuals with schizophrenia and SMI broadly
identified several health-related topics, and in fact do so more than
controls. Specifically, participants discussed food and diet and several
lifestyle factors, such as routines, hobbies, and living situations.
Interestingly, the relative frequency of health-related topics compared
to all other topics was not significantly different between individuals
with schizophrenia, individuals with other SMI diagnoses, and controls.
However, we find several individual topics that are brought up by
individuals with schizophrenia more frequently than individuals with
other SMI diagnoses, including several lifestyle factors. The most
striking topic to emerge from these unstructured interviews was the
first one, which broadly discusses food and diet, and for which the top
four contributing words are “food, eat, cook, love.” In planning these
exploratory analyses, we considered the possibility that individuals
with SMI would discuss health-related topics, but in a manner that did
not clearly identify the valence they associate with these behaviors.
That was not the case. It is clear that, at least in this sample of
individuals with SMI, food is positively valenced. Maintaining that
positive relationship with food, rather than a punitive diet framework,
will likely be beneficial for long term health promotion. Negatively
valenced emotion topics, particularly “scared”, also emerged as
health-related topics. Closer examination of the other words in the
topic suggests that the health-related component may be “run”, which in
this topic could be the activity, or could be something related to
escape. In sum, it is clear from these analyses that individuals with
SMI, primarily schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, are
actively thinking about their health even when not explicitly prompted
to, and areas of primary importance to them are food and diet and their
general lifestyle and routines.

One potential health-related domain also stands out for its absence in
the topics extracted from these speech samples. Even though some of the
speech samples targeted negatively valenced memories and experiences the
participants have had, there was not a clearly related disability,
sickness, or chronic illness topic. There are several possible
interpretations to this absence. First, the participants may have had
these experiences, but they were not sufficiently salient to be
discussed in these interviews. It does appear that many of the
negatively valenced topics coalesce around more interpersonal stress or
negative experiences like lethargy. These may simply be more common or
clearly negative experiences for the individuals in the sample, and
therefore the memories which came to mind. It may also be that the
participants in our sample, though on average middle aged, had not yet
had many significant negative health outcomes to this point. Globally,
individuals with schizophrenia live to an average age of 64.7 years old
[(Hjorthøj et al. 2017)], and our sample was approximately two decades
younger, and therefore may have not yet developed chronic health
conditions which are common in this population, such as diabetes or
cardiovascular diseases [(De Hert et al. 2011),(Brown, Inskip, and
Barraclough 2000)]. A third possibility is that it reflects diagnostic
overshadowing, or even internalized diagnostic overshadowing. Diagnostic
overshadowing typically refers to the phenomenon of individuals with SMI
receiving worse physical health care, not least because medical doctors
are apt to attribute their concerns to psychiatric symptoms [(Shefer et
al. 2014),(Thornicroft 2011),(van Nieuwenhuizen et al. 2012)]. It is
conceivable that our sample has yet to receive proper diagnosis for
disabilities. It is also possible that there has been an aspect of
internalized diagnostic overshadowing, analogous to internalization of
stigma, where the individuals in our sample have learnt that the most
significant contributions to their health and wellbeing are their
psychiatric symptoms, and that their physical health symptoms are less
relevant.

Implications for Health Promotion
---------------------------------

Our findings have several critical implications for health promotion
initiatives for individuals with schizophrenia. First and foremost, they
suggest the importance of targeting diet. In the general population,
diet has been identified as a key component of improving cardiovascular
health [(O’Keefe, Gheewala, and O’Keefe 2008)] and mitigating negative
outcomes from diabetes [(Sami et al. 2017)]. Given that this is already
a topic which is important to individuals with schizophrenia, this may
indicate a domain of their life where health promotion initiatives can
have significant impact. However, one crucial nuance that our findings
suggest is the importance of a positive association with food. In a
population where a loss of pleasure (i.e., anhedonia) is a cardinal
symptom, the fact that food, eating, and cooking were strongly
positively valenced suggests the importance of the hedonic component of
food. As such, heavily restrictive diets (i.e., elimination diets) could
be particularly ineffective in this population (though these diets are
generally ineffective, even in populations without mental health
diagnoses [(McEvedy et al. 2017)]). Instead, advice on diet should focus
on maintaining cooking and eating as a source of joy through providing
culturally appropriate, non-shaming health-promoting additions to the
individual’s diet. However, this does not necessarily suggest that the
primary strategy should be individualized diet advice, though that may
be useful. Instead, it is important to understand the relation between
diet, eating, and social context, and interventions need to work on
individual, microsystem, and exosystem levels [(Bronfenbrenner 1992)].
At the broadest level, policy initiatives such as ensuring the access to
plentiful healthy food options [(Berkowitz et al. 2018)] and the
infrastructure for cooking it, are required—without access no other
intervention can succeed. Subsequently, interventions which stimulate
the creation or maintenance of supportive attitudes within the
individuals’ social network [(Fortuna et al. 2022)] and providing
individual diet information and strategies for integrating
health-promoting cooking styles will be required to make substantial
changes in the health of individuals with schizophrenia. A similar
strategy or perspective could be applied to initiatives to increase
exercise in this population. Research shows higher rates of sedentarity
in individuals with schizophrenia [(Soundy et al. 2013)], but also the
importance of self-determination in motivation towards increased
physical activity in individuals with schizophrenia [(Vancampfort et al.
2013)]. Our results suggest hobbies are important to individuals with
SMI. Increasing the ease and frequency with which individuals can
participate in exercise-related hobbies, for example, by increasing
access to greenspace or to safe neighborhoods, can increase both
physical and mental health for individuals with SMI [(Henson et al.
2020),(South et al. 2018),(Walsan et al. 2020)].

5. Limitations and Future Directions
====================================

The results of this study should be interpreted considering some
limitations. It is to be expected with topic modeling that sample
characteristics and task characteristics will have a substantial impact
on the topics extracted. Several factors at play in our samples may have
influenced the topics. First and foremost, the samples were drawn from
studies collected across a decade, and in two different parts of the
United States. Replication across different samples will be necessary.
Within our samples, we did not find significant differences in the
topics extracted based on ethnicity, but future work should expand the
samples and the ethnic groups included and explore whether these
findings replicate. If these findings do not replicate, it may suggest
limits to generalizability, and ways that either policy or intervention
ought to be culturally adapted, whether that reflects the broader
culture of a geographic region or the culture of a particular ethnic or
racial group. Finally, these results reflect the prompts which were
provided to the participants, which were not specifically health
related, but some of the speech prompts targeted good memories, bad
memories, or neutral experiences. Still, health related topics emerged
prominently, showing that these are integral to individuals with SMI’s
self-narratives.

.. _sec6-behavsci-12-00286:

6. Conclusions
==============

Relatively unstructured speech samples from individuals with SMI,
primarily schizophrenia, were analyzed using natural language processing
and topic modeling to explore what health-related ideas were critical to
this population. Topics around food, living situation, and lifestyle
(e.g., routine, hobbies) emerged. There was a notable lack of topics
specifically relating to ill health. The topics which are primary to
individuals with schizophrenia, and how they were discussed, provide
information on how to create more effective interventions to improve the
health and wellbeing of this population.
