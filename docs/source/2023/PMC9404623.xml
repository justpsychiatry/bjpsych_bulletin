Lurasidone, a second-generation atypical antipsychotic, represents an additional treatment option alongside existing antipsychotics for adolescents and adults with schizophrenia. An economic model was developed to evaluate the incremental costs of lurasidone as a first-line treatment option compared to existing antipsychotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost impact of lurasidone as a first-line treatment option for both adolescents and adults. The sequence-based model incorporated the following health states: stable (no relapse or discontinuation), discontinuation (due to adverse events or other reasons), and relapse. Data used to determine the movement of patients between health states were obtained from network meta-analyses (NMAs). The time horizon ranged from three to five years (depending on the patient population) and a six-weekly cycle length was used. Unit costs and resource use were reflective of the UK NHS and Personal Social Services and consisted of the following categories: outpatient, adverse events, primary and residential care. Extensive deterministic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the level of uncertainty associated with the base case results.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Lurasidone is demonstrated to be cost-saving as a first-line treatment within the adolescent and adult populations when compared to second-line and third-line respectively. Lurasidone is more expensive in terms of treatment costs, resource use (in the stable health state) and the treatment of adverse events. However, these costs are outweighed by the savings associated with the relapse health state. Lurasidone remains cost-saving when inputs are varied in sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Lurasidone is a cost-saving first-line treatment for schizophrenia for both adolescents and adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-022-08436-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Lurasidone</kwd><kwd>Cost analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2022</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par18">Schizophrenia is a serious mental health characterised by distortions in thought processes, perception, mood, sense of self, and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The symptoms of schizophrenia are typically characterised as positive (such as hallucinations, delusions, and movement disorders), negative (such as emotional apathy, lack of motivation and social withdrawal) and cognitive (such as impairment in cognitive functioning reduced attention span and memory problems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Schizophrenia can have a detrimental effect on personal, social, educational, and occupational functioning and place a heavy burden on parents and carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Whilst there is no cure for schizophrenia, evidence shows that it can be treated effectively using pharmacological and psychosocial therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Alternative antipsychotics are licensed for patients aged 18 and over (brexpiprazole and cariprazine). Therefore, patients within the adult population were able to receive either lurasidone, brexpiprazole or cariprazine upon entry to the model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Model overview</title><p id="Par22">A Markov sequenced-based model was developed in Microsoft Excel to assess the cost impact of lurasidone as a first-line treatment when compared to second-line and third-line within the adolescent and adult populations respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The model structure, and corresponding assumptions, was designed in alignment with an economic model developed by NICE to inform the clinical guideline of schizophrenia in adults and a model submitted to NICE for the appraisal of aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 15&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of base case model structure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2022_8436_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">A hypothetical cohort with diagnosed schizophrenia entered the model and received first-line treatment with either lurasidone, or an alternative antipsychotic, and their condition was classified as stable (the patient was continuing to receive treatment with no relapse).

Patients discontinuing first-line treatment due to other reasons were assumed to stop treatment abruptly and move onto no treatment where they remained until they experienced a relapse. All patients experiencing a relapse were assumed to stop any antipsychotic drug that they had been receiving whilst in the stable health state and, instead, were treated for the acute relapse episode. Following relapse, patients either returned to their previous antipsychotic medication (if they had previously discontinued treatment for other reasons) or switched to second-line treatment. Patients discontinuing treatment because of intolerable side effects, or other reasons, were assumed not to experience a relapse for the remaining duration of the cycle within which discontinuation occurred.</p><p id="Par30">It was assumed that the discontinuation of an antipsychotic because of intolerable side effects only occurred during the first six weeks of use. However, discontinuation due to other reasons was possible across the remainder of cycles within the model. Patients may have also experienced side effects that did not lead to discontinuation (tolerable side effects). In these cases, it was assumed that patients continued to take the antipsychotic until they discontinued it for any other reason. It was also possible for patients to die within any health state.</p><p id="Par31">A six-weekly cycle was chosen to align with the follow-up period included within the network meta-analyses (NMA) that were used to inform treatment discontinuation within the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. All transitions in the model, for purposes of estimations of costs, were assumed to occur in the middle of each cycle. The number of weeks and/or years that a patient spent in each health state was estimated over the time horizon of the model. Time horizons of five and three years were used within the adolescent populations (13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years and 15&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years respectively) to replicate the maximum duration an individual would remain within their initial patient group before being considered an adult. A time horizon of five years was used within the adult population.</p><p id="Par32">The model structure for the adult population was very similar across the adolescent and adult populations. However, the treatment sequences (and subsequent efficacy and safety data), differed across the populations (as presented below).

The first NMA was designed to estimate the efficacy and safety of lurasidone, brexpiprazole and cariprazine as treatments for schizophrenia. The systematic review used to inform the feasibility assessment of this NMA only identified one trial within the adolescent population and, therefore, this NMA was limited to the adult population. The second NMA focused on treatments specifically licensed for adolescents (lurasidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone and haloperidol).</p><p id="Par43">The outputs of both NMAs were used to inform the odds ratios of discontinuation, compared to placebo, associated with each of the interventions. Based on these odds ratios, the odds of discontinuation with each intervention could then be estimated when compared with placebo. All odds were then converted to a probability to facilitate inclusion in the economic model. Discontinuation due to a lack of efficacy, as reported in the NMA, was assumed to be a suitable proxy for discontinuation due to other reasons. No studies assessing either the efficacy or the safety of haloperidol were identified from the systematic literature review informing the second NMA. Furthermore, clozapine was not included within either NMA. Therefore, the probabilities of discontinuation associated with haloperidol and clozapine were obtained from alternative sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

The definition of relapse used within this NMA was dependent on that used in each of the clinical trials. The most common definitions of relapse were a rating scale-based criteria, hospital admission or a combination of the two. The annual relapse rate associated with placebo was converted to a six-weekly probability to account for the cycle length within the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

These adverse events were assumed to occur within the first six weeks of treatment and, therefore, one-off treatment costs were applied within the base case analysis.</p><p id="Par47">An NMA of randomised controlled trials of 32 antipsychotics was used to determine the relative risk of a patient experiencing a&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7% increase in weight compared to placebo, except for clozapine which was not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Therefore, this SMR was applied to the age-related population norm mortality data to generate schizophrenia-specific values suitable for the model.

Lurasidone as a first-line treatment is more expensive in terms of treatment costs&#x000a0;and resource use in the stable health state&#x000a0;in all populations. However, lurasidone is associated with a lower number of relapses in all populations. Therefore, these increased costs are outweighed by the savings associated with the relapse health state meaning lurasidone is cost-saving as a first-line treatment when compared to lurasidone as a third-line treatment. A further cost breakdown by resource category is presented within the supplementary appendix (supplementary Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1.5.6</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p id="Par68">The results of the DSA (as presented within the <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">supplementary appendix</xref>) show that the discontinuation rate (due to other reasons) associated with lurasidone is the primary driver of the cost model results when all other inputs remain constant at base case settings. Discontinuation rates (due to intolerable adverse events and other reasons), relapse and residential costs associated with relapse are also key drivers of the model results. Only the discontinuation rate due to other reasons associated with lurasidone caused lurasidone to become cost-incurring as a first-line treatment when compared to second-line, in the adolescent (aged 13&#x02013;17 population). No other inputs cause lurasidone to become cost-incurring when varied across the three populations. Tornado plots for each of the populations are presented within the supplementary material (see supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par69">The results of the PSA are similar to the base case analysis in all populations, with lurasidone as a first-line treatment being cost-saving in all populations (see supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Lurasidone as a starting treatment was cost-saving in 86.5%, 76.8% and 70.4% of iterations within the 13&#x02013;17, 13&#x02013;15 and 18&#x000a0;years and above populations respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par70">The results of the cost model indicate that lurasidone is cost-saving as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia versus second-line, and third-line, within both the adolescent (aged 13&#x02013;17 and 15&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years) and adult populations respectively. Lurasidone is associated with greater treatment, stable health state and adverse event costs when used as a first-line treatment within all populations. However, these additional costs are outweighed by the cost-savings incurred through patients spending less time within the relapse health state. Therefore, there could be savings to the NHS for the optimisation of schizophrenia treatment sequences, namely through the use of lurasidone earlier in the sequence.</p><p id="Par71">The model only considers the cost implications of the use of lurasidone as first-line treatment compared to second and third-line (within the adolescent and adult populations respectively), with no consideration of the patient health-related quality of life (which considers the impact that a disease has on a patient&#x02019;s functioning and well-being). However, it is expected that patients would experience a reduction in quality of life whilst receiving treatment for a relapse episode. Lurasidone is associated with a lower relapse rate and, therefore, it is expected that lurasidone may also lead to a greater quality of life when taken as first-line rather than second and third-line within the adolescent and adult populations, respectively. The increased quality of life associated with lurasidone as a first-line treatment should be demonstrated through further research.</p><p id="Par72">The authors are aware of one previous economic evaluation estimating the cost-utility of lurasidone compared to aripiprazole (both followed by amisulpride and clozapine) in adults with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The results of this economic evaluation are not directly comparable to this study, because it was conducted from a Scottish perspective, and compared different treatment options. However, although the treatment sequence containing lurasidone was associated with higher drug, outpatient and residential costs across both the present and Scottish models, these additional costs were outweighed by savings associated with relapse (which contributed to the greatest proportion of costs).</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par73">The incremental cost of several different treatment sequences could be assessed using the model and several assumptions were made regarding the treatment sequences modelled. The NICE guidelines do not outline any specific treatment sequences and, as such, the sequences modelled may not reflect the order of antipsychotics received by all patients with schizophrenia within the UK. Furthermore, whilst there are similar modes of action between comparators, it is unclear whether the efficacy of subsequent lines of treatment is independent of treatments received previously. Limited evidence was available regarding the potential degradation in treatment effects if a patient had taken an alternative treatment previously. Due to a lack of alternative information to suggest otherwise, the model currently assumes the efficacy of each intervention is not dependent upon the treatment line.</p><p id="Par74">One strength of this model is that the implementation of a Markov model allows the long-term costs of schizophrenia to be estimated and allows sufficient time for patients to receive all treatments within the sequence. The model structure within the adolescent (aged 13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years) population also takes into consideration the fact that treatment options change once patients reach the age of 15, due to licencing differences. The structure of the model, and its inputs, also align with an economic model developed by NICE to inform the clinical guideline of schizophrenia in adults and a model submitted to NICE for the appraisal of aripiprazole (TA213) for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 15&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">The probability of discontinuation due to intolerable adverse events and other reasons, relapse rates and probability of intolerable adverse events were informed by NMAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. NMAs are robust sources of efficacy data, since they use both direct and indirect evidence to estimate the comparative efficacy of several interventions to each other and reduce bias caused by differences in trial designs and populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Therefore, the efficacy data used to inform the model is likely to be particularly robust. However, it was not possible to identify one NMA that reported all the outcomes required to populate the model.</p><p id="Par76">It should be noted that the NMAs used to inform the discontinuation parameters produced results for individual dosages of each antipsychotic, rather than as a combination. However, a wide range of dosages for each intervention are used throughout the UK (the rates for each dose are uncertain). Whilst efficacy data were applied in the model for the doses that are expected to be the most commonly used (according to the BNF and summary of product characteristics), the discontinuation efficacy parameters are unlikely to be reflective of the whole patient population within the UK receiving each antipsychotic given the variation in the doses administered.</p><p id="Par77">The six-weekly probability discontinuation of haloperidol due to intolerable adverse events was also taken from an NMA analysis of the dose&#x02013;response effects of lurasidone on acute schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This NMA reported results of the opposite direction for all dosages of lurasidone, which may positively bias the adolescent results in favour of lurasidone. It must also be noted that the confidence intervals were extremely wide across all NMA results and, therefore, these inputs are associated with uncertainty.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par78">Lurasidone is demonstrated to be cost-saving when used earlier in the schizophrenia treatment sequence, within all populations, because patients receiving this treatment spend less time within the relapse health state (which is the most-costly health state).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
