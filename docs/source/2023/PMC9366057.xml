Schizophrenia is the most common group of psychiatric disorders characterized by basic personality changes, splitting of thinking, emotions, and behavior, and incompatibility of mental activities with the environment, and the MMPI-2 is a recognized measurement tool to assist in screening patients with schizophrenia. The lifetime prevalence in urban China areas is 0.83%, and it was estimated that there were 7.16 million people in China suffering from schizophrenia in 2010 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Diagnosing schizophrenia is the first step for professionals to take intervention and provide them suitable support. Early detection and diagnosis of schizophrenia are of research interest because they can benefit both clinical professionals and patients. Early detection and filtering without clinical professional effort can relieve the burden in the clinics and facilitate the early intervention, which alleviates the severity and chronicity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical fields is difficult, and current practices have received several challenges. The major reason is that diagnosing schizophrenia in clinics relies on clinical observations of specific symptoms over a month using the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) guidelines. Though these guidelines are widely adopted in clinics, they have been criticized in several aspects. 1. A high diagnostic threshold is needed for schizophrenia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). 2. Various symptom profiles occur in the exiting guideline (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These difficulties make the diagnosis of schizophrenia time-consuming and heavily rely on professional clinical experience. It is hard for professionals to diagnose accurately and effectively. An innovative exploration of clinical symptoms of schizophrenia is conducive to helping medical professionals better understand schizophrenia, and facilitate the realization of early detection and diagnosis.</p><p>Existing research studies on detecting schizophrenia in the early stage can be categorized into using magnetic resonance image (MRI) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and the psychometric test (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The psychometric test is a self-completed questionnaire that is not limited by the availability of MRI scanners and radiologists. The psychometric test provides an off-the-shelf and less expensive option than MRI for early scanning and detection of schizophrenia.</p><p>Many studies have examined the feasibility of differentiating schizophrenia patients from other psychiatric disorders or healthy adults using MMPI. Using the available clinical scales as indicators of schizophrenia is a common approach (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and the other approach (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) is constructing a new scale by selecting relevant questions from the MMPI questions. Building a new scale can effectively screen schizophrenia patients by selecting relevant questions in MMPI tests. The shortcoming is that these specific scales were not widely adopted in other circumstances and, therefore, adoption in different demographics might require additional validation before use. In contrast, using existing scales might not be as discriminative as specific scales, but it is convenient and widely used in most demographics.</p><p>Early research studies in the MMPI have studied the discriminative power of MMPI Clinical scales and the difference between schizophrenia patients and other populations. Many research studies (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) indicated a statistical significance of a higher Scale 8 in schizophrenia patients. Research study (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) pointed out that patients with schizophrenia usually exhibit lower scores on Scale 2 (Depression). Evidence (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) also supported the aforementioned finding in the MMPI-2, a revised version of MMPI. In summary, different from the 278 codetype in the MMPI-2 manual, most of the research has a major consensus (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) is that a lower score in Scale 2 (Depression), and 7 (Psychasthenia) and a higher score in Scale 8 (Schizophrenia) are a sign of schizophrenia.</p><p>Nonetheless, research teams less addressed the correlations between MMPI clinical scales in different populations explicitly. A previous study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) pointed out a high correlation between clinical Scale 8 and validity Scale F. The existence of correlation among MMPI-2 scales affects the interpretation of classification results because such correlation within MMPI-2 clinical scales violates the assumption of the regression that these independent variables are independent. This research investigates these correlations between MMPI-2 clinical scales and examines whether there is any difference in MMPI-2 clinical scales correlation between schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals, which has an important reference value for the interpretation of the scale results and the clinical work of diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p><p>This study used a data-driven approach and investigated the correlation and its difference in the MMPI-2 clinical scales between schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals through the separated Bayesian network. This study examined the interaction between Scale 278 in patients with schizophrenia, providing a more comprehensive understanding and sketching of schizophrenia MMPI-2 clinical scales. Overall, the finding could benefit medical professionals in better understanding the symptoms of schizophrenia and providing guidance for clinical diagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 9,216 participants completed MMPI-2 during their visit to Wuhan Psychiatric Hospital from March 2008 to May 2018.

scales and their relation to schizophrenia, as researchers are concerned about how the combination of different scales affects the prediction outcome. The Bayesian network provides the fruitful interpretation of the dependency structure in the MMPI-2 clinical scales and, thus, provides both the prediction outcome and insightful interpretations.</p><p>Bayesian networks were used to analyze the MMPI-2 clinical scales and three validity scales, L, F, and K, in this study. Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model. Bayesian networks denote the variables (i.e., the MMPI clinical scales in this study) as the node. While a node pair shows a dependence structure, then the arc is connected between them. If a node is connected by several nodes, that means this node is jointly dependent on these nodes. The arc strength is to quantify the magnitude of the dependence structure. The measurement criterium is Bayesian information criteria that measure the model's goodness.</p><p>If a normal distributed variable node <italic>Y</italic> is pointed by a normally distributed nodes set <italic>X</italic> then there is a linear probabilistic relationship. In other words, it can be expressed as <italic>Y</italic> = &#x003b2;<italic>x</italic>+<italic>c</italic>, where &#x003b2; is the coefficient and <italic>c</italic> is the constant. The Bayesian network quantifies the linear correlation between each MMPI-2 and delineates the interaction of these variables. Furthermore, it examines the difference in correlation between schizophrenia patients and healthy people. The correlation test was made the method proposed by Wang et al.

F-Sc arc found in this study has been identified in previous studies (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Si-D and Sc-Pt are the arcs related to the Scale 278 used in differentiating schizophrenia patients. L and K scales were the validity score that quantified a person's behavior on under-reporting their psychological symptoms (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This evidence showed that the Bayesian network was able to align with the previous findings. In addition, some new findings were obtained through the Bayesian network. We constructed separated Bayesian networks of healthy participants and schizophrenia patients in the MMPI clinical scale and identified all of the arcs, and these arcs represent the correlations between nodes. This method is a generative model which can predict not only schizophrenia but also the range of scores from one scale to another scale.</p><sec><title>Network structure</title><p>The main findings of this study were obtained through the network structure on the MMPI clinical scales of healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia. We could observe the correlation and differences between the scales in the arcs of two network structures. We found some arcs in both networks, suggesting that healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia had some common responses on the MMPI clinical scales. Besides, study found differences in scale correlation between the two network structures. The method has identified that the correlation differences between healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia are majorly in Hs, D, Pd, and Mf scales. In the MMPI, these subscales mainly measure abnormal concern for bodily functions (Hs), content related to depression, apathy, pessimism, and slowness of thought and action (D), personality (Pd), and degree of masculinity or femininity (Mf). In addition to these sub-scales related to schizophrenia symptoms, disorganized thinking, emotional indifference, and bizarre behavior as measured by the Sc scale are also important considerations in distinguishing schizophrenia. Furthermore, some arcs existed only in the network structure of healthy participants or patients with schizophrenia. Eight arcs were found only in the network of patients with schizophrenia, but the correlations these arcs were weak. Therefore, it is more worthy of our attention that the Bayesian network method finds that D-Pt, Pd-Ma, and Hs-F arcs only exist in the network structure of healthy participants, and there was a high correlation between these scales.</p><p>This study further explored the reasons behind this result and its clinical significance. The difference in the MMPI-2 correlation matrix in network structure could be viewed as the correlation difference between schizophrenia patients' MMPI response and normal people's MMPI response. These differences can be two folds. 1. The structural difference between the two networks indicated that there was a linear correlation in one type of people, and the other did not exhibit such correlation. 2. Even if a link exists in both networks, the linear relationship might behave differently; thus, we can observe such a difference. Bearing the above concepts, we could observe the following findings. The D-Pt arc and Pd-Ma arc were correlated only in the healthy participant network and presented as arcs. This suggests that there are common patterns in these two pairs of responses that patients with schizophrenia do not exhibit. The presence or absence of these two arcs can be observed to assist clinicians in diagnosing schizophrenia. Although the Hs-F arc was moderately correlated in the network structure of both healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia, the Hs-F arc disappeared due to the presence of the Sc-Hs arc in the network structure of patients with schizophrenia. The reason for this phenomenon is that the subject is schizophrenia, so the subject will inevitably have significant clinical manifestations on the two scales of schizophrenia (Sc) and psychopathy (Hs). Thus, Sc-Hs arcs appear in the network structure of patients with schizophrenia but not in the network structure of healthy participants. Therefore, for patients with schizophrenia, the Sc scale is directly related to the Hs scale, which is expressed in the Sc-Hs arc. For healthy participants without Sc-Hs arcs, the association between the Sc scale and Hs scale was indirectly linked through the F scale. Based on the above findings, in clinical practice, when clinical workers try to explain the corresponding clinical symptoms through the correlation between the two scales, the results of the F scale can better explain the results of the Hs scale for healthy individuals, while for patients with schizophrenia, the results of Sc scale can better explain the results of Hs scale.</p></sec><sec><title>The interaction between Scale 278</title><p>The other finding of this study was an interaction between Scale 278. Based on previous studies that lower 2, lower 7, and higher 8 are a sign of schizophrenia, we observed that the lower Scale 7 is the consequence of the higher Scale 8 and lower Scale 2. We could observe that setting either Scale 2 at a lower level or Scale 8 at a higher level will result in the conclusion that schizophrenia has a higher Scale 8 and lower Scale 2 and 7. Nonetheless, setting scale 7 at the lower level does not result. Given the above observation, we concluded that the interaction on Scale 278 for schizophrenia was mainly from the higher Scale 8 and lower Scale 2. This result helped us further validate the typical sign of schizophrenia in MPPI-2 and more vividly delineate the relationship between 278 scales. The proposed method provides a novel perspective of interpretation of the interaction between Depression, Psychasthenia, and Schizophrenia scales. This perspective facilitates clinical workers to interpret the meaning behind the scores of the three scales and helps them better understand schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>The Bayesian network</title><p>This study also found the unique application value of the Bayesian network in MMPI. The Bayesian network method constructed a network structure for the response patterns of healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia on the MPPI-2 clinical scale, respectively. The Bayesian network structure presented the different degrees of correlation and interactions between each clinical scale. In addition to classifying schizophrenia patients from healthy, researchers can use the Bayesian network to predict the score range of one scale through the score of another scale and infer the overall data from part of the observed data. Therefore, this Bayesian network method can estimate the overall score only by the scores of several scales, which can help clinical workers perform preliminary filtering of schizophrenia more efficiently, lighten the burden of work and improve efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>There are two limitations of this study. One limitation is that the proposed method relied on the nature that the predictors are continuous (MMPI-2 scales), and the target outcome is a binary variable (Diagnosis). Instead of solving a Bayesian network with hybrid variables, separated continuous Bayesian networks for healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia were built. The classification decision was made according to the posterior probability of all MMPI-2 clinical scales. Advance algorithms might be developed to diagnose through the Bayesian networks in the future directly in the mixed variable situation. This is especially valuable for the reason that binary or nominal demographic variables (such as gender) could be included in the model. The other limitation is that the participants of this study came from a single hospital. The demographics might not reflect other cultural and endemic differences in other countries.We would like to expand the population to include more participants from various backgrounds and mental diseases to study the endemic and cultural differences and differential diagnoses between different mental diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, a separated Bayesian network was used to construct the network structure of the MPPI-2 clinical scale between healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia.
